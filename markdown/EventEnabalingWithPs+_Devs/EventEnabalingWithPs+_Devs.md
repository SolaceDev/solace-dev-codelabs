# Event Enabaling with Solace PubSub+ for developers

## What you'll learn: Overview

Duration: 0:05:00

This codelab follows the <b>Event Enabaling with Solace PubSub+ for developers</b> workshop and contains the hands-on section of the workshop. \
In this codelab, we will be doing hands-on activities on the following topics:
- Solace basics : Getting started
- Topics and subscriptions
- Queues and persistent messaging
- Event Meshes and DMR
- Distributed tracing
- Cloud REST API



## Solace Basics : Getting started

Follow the link to the codelab over here : [A Solace Primer - Getting Started with Solace PubSub+ Event Broker](https://codelabs.solace.dev/codelabs/get-started-basics/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0)

## Topics and subscription : Overview using Try-Me

Follow the link to the codelab over here : [Topic Hierarchies and Wildcards](https://codelabs.solace.dev/codelabs/get-started-basics/index.html?index=..%2F..index#6)

## Topics and subscription : Code driven hands-on

## Event mesh and DMRs
Follow the link to the codelab over here : [DMR (Event Mesh) Exploration Procedures](https://codelabs.solace.dev/codelabs/explore-dmr/index.html?index=..%2F..index#2)

## Distributed tracing
Follow the link to the codelab over here : [Getting Started with Solace Distributed Tracing and Context Propagation](https://codelabs.solace.dev/codelabs/dt-otel/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0)

## Event Portal
Follow the link to the codelab over here : [Design to Code using Event Portal + AsyncAPI Code Generation](https://codelabs.solace.dev/codelabs/design-to-code-workshop/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) \
<!-- Follow the link to the codelab over here : [Design to Code using Event Portal + AsyncAPI Code Generation](https://codelabs.solace.dev/codelabs/design-to-code-workshop/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) --> \
Follow the link to the codelab over here : [Creating Event API Products using Spring Cloud Stream, Event Portal and AsyncAPI](https://codelabs.solace.dev/codelabs/create-api-products-using-scs-and-ep/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) \

## Cloud REST API
The Solace Cloud REST APIs are documented over here : [PubSub+ Cloud REST APIs](https://api.solace.dev/cloud/reference/using-the-v2-rest-apis-for-pubsub-cloud)\
As explained in the workshop, the v2 Cloud REST APIs are classified into 3 categories :
- Mission Control APIs
- Event Portal - Designer APIs
- Event Portal - Runtime APIs
- Platform and billing APIs

In this section, we will see how to make a request for few common scenarios that are encountered in a real-life impelementation :
- Creating an event broker service
- Retreiving the details of an event broker service
- Get a list of available software event broker versions
- Getting a list of available event broker services
- Getting a list of users in your account

To perform these actions, for simplicity sake we will use the try-me functionality included in the documentation page.



Start off with creating an authentication bearer token as described over here : [Authentication bearer token](https://api.solace.dev/cloud/reference/authentication)\
Keep this token secure as we will be using it for the rest of the steps.
