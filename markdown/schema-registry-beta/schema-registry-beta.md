## What Is A Schema Registry

Duration: 0:02:00

A schema registry is a central repository for managing and storing schemas. It helps ensure data consistency, enables data governance, and supports schema evolution. Here's why it's important:

1. **Data Consistency**: Ensures that producers and consumers agree on the data format.
2. **Interoperability**: Allows different systems to communicate effectively.
3. **Schema Evolution**: Supports versioning and compatibility checks as schemas change over time.
4. **Data Governance**: Centralizes schema management for better control and auditing.

> In this walkthrough, we'll use the Apicurio Registry as our schema registry, which provides a comprehensive solution for managing schemas in your event-driven architecture.

## What Is A SERDEs

Duration: 0:02:00

A SERDEs (Serializer/Deserializer) in the context of a schema registry is a component that handles two key functions:
1. **Serialization**: Converting data objects from their native format (like Java objects) into a binary format suitable for transmission or storage.
2. **Deserialization**: Converting the binary data back into its original format for processing.   

In a schema registry system, SERDEs work closely with schemas to:
- Ensure data consistency during serialization/deserialization
- Validate that messages conform to the registered schema

For example:
- A serializer might take a Java object and convert it to Avro binary format using a schema from the registry
- A deserializer would then use the same schema to correctly reconstruct the object from the binary data

This is a fundamental concept in message-based systems where data needs to be:
- Efficiently transmitted between different services
- Properly validated against defined schemas
- Correctly interpreted by different applications that might be written in different programming languages

## Setting up Apicurio Registry

Duration: 0:06:00

We'll use Docker Compose to set up the Apicurio Registry quickly and easily. We've prepared a Docker Compose file that will launch an instance of the Apicurio Registry and all the necessary components with a pre-defined configuration.

1. In these subsequent steps we will use the package that came from the downloaded zip from the prerequisites section. Navigate to the extracted folder called ```Schema-Registry-Beta-Package```. You should see the following files and folders:
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/SrBetaPackageFolderView.jpg" />
</p>


2. Open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the extracted location of the folder called ```solace-schema-registry-dist```.

3. Optionally you can make changes to the ```.env``` file to change things such as default login or ports. We will leave everything to defaults for this codelab.

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/EnvFile.jpg" />
</p>

4. Run the following command: ```docker compose up -d``` and all the components will start up with the default values configured.

5. Once the script is done running, you should now be able to go to your browser and navigate to ```localhost:8888``` which should re-direct you to the Apicurio Registry login screen.

  <img src="img/SrLoginEmpty.jpg" />
</p>

That's it, you have now installed an instance of the Apicurio Registry with the Postgres storage option!

## Creating and Registering Schemas

Duration: 0:04:00

Let's create a simple schema for a ```User``` event:

1. Open the Apicurio Registry UI in your web browser by going to ```localhost:8888```.
2. Login with the predefined credentials for a developer. In this case the username is ```sr-developer``` and password is ```devPassword```.   

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/SrLogin.jpg" />
</p>

3. Click on ```Create artifact``` button. Once the dialogue opens enter the following as shown below:
    * Group Id: Leave it empty (default)
    * Artifact Id: Set to ```solace/samples```
    * Type: Set to ```Avro Schema```   

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/SrCreateArtifact.jpg" />
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/SrCreateArtifact1.jpg" />
</p>

4. We will skip the ```Artifact Metadata``` step as it is optional and will click ```Next```. 

5. For the "Version Content" section, copy the Avro schema from below and either paste directly or save it into a file and upload it and click ```Next``` when done. 
```json
{
  "namespace": "com.solace.samples.serdes.avro.schema",
  "type": "record",
  "name": "User",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "id", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "name", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "email", "type": "string"}
  ]
}
```  

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/SrCreateArtifact2.jpg" />
</p>

6. We will skip the ```Version Metadata``` step as it is optional and will simply click the ```Create``` button. 

7. Finally after you have successfully created the new schema you should see the following:   

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/SrCreateArtifactDone.jpg" />
</p>

You've now created and registered your first schema!

## Using Schemas with the Solace Messaging API for Java (JCSMP)

Duration: 0:10:00

Now, let's see how to use this schema in Java using the Solace Messaging API for Java (JCSMP):

1. Open a command window or terminal in the ```Schema-Registry-Beta-Package/jcsmp-samples``` directory.

NOTE: For winows users, use the ```gradlew.bat``` file instead of ```gradlew``` in the below steps.

2. Run the following command to build the sample on Windows ```./gradlew.bat build``` and . You should see a ```BUILD SUCCESSFUL``` message.          

3. Run the sample application and provide the broker connection details like so ```./gradlew.bat runHelloWorldJCSMPAvroSerde --args="localhost:55555 default default"```. 

This sample talks to the locally deployed Apicurio Schema Registry and retrieves the schema along with the schema ID. It will then do the following:

Configures the Serializer and Deserializer:
```java
// Create and configure Avro serializer and deserializer
        try (Serializer<GenericRecord> serializer = new AvroSerializer<>();
             Deserializer<GenericRecord> deserializer = new AvroDeserializer<>()) {

            serializer.configure(getConfig());
            deserializer.configure(getConfig());
```
```java
   /**
     * Returns a configuration map for the Avro serializer and deserializer.
     *
     * @return A Map containing configuration properties
     */
    private static Map<String, Object> getConfig() {
        Map<String, Object> config = new HashMap<>();
        config.put(SchemaResolverProperties.REGISTRY_URL, REGISTRY_URL);
        config.put(SchemaResolverProperties.AUTH_USERNAME, REGISTRY_USERNAME);
        config.put(SchemaResolverProperties.AUTH_PASSWORD, REGISTRY_PASSWORD);
        return config;
    }
```


Serializes the message payload and publishes the message to the connected broker on ```solace/samples``` destination with the serialized payload and schema ID:
```java
   // Create and populate a GenericRecord with sample data
            GenericRecord user = initEmptyUserRecord();
            user.put("name", "John Doe");
            user.put("id", "123");
            user.put("email", "support@solace.com");

            // Serialize and send the message
            BytesMessage msg = JCSMPFactory.onlyInstance().createMessage(BytesMessage.class);
            SerdeMessage.serialize(serializer, topic, msg, user);
            System.out.printf("Sending Message:%n%s%n", msg.dump());
            producer.send(msg, topic);
```

It will then receive the published message and deserialize it by looking up the schema ID and retrieving the schema and print it out to console:
```java
  // Set up the message consumer with a deserialization callback
            XMLMessageConsumer cons = session.getMessageConsumer(Consumed.with(deserializer, (msg, genericRecord) -> {
                System.out.printf("Got record: %s%n", genericRecord);
                latch.countDown(); // Signal the main thread that a message has been received
            }, (msg, deserializationException) -> {
                System.out.printf("Got exception: %s%n", deserializationException);
                System.out.printf("But still have access to the message: %s%n", msg.dump());
                latch.countDown();
            }, jcsmpException -> {
                System.out.printf("Got exception: %s%n", jcsmpException);
                latch.countDown();
            }));
            cons.start();
```

The sourcecode can be further looked at by opening the ```HelloWorldJCSMPAvroSerde.java``` file.

## Best Practices for Schema Evolution

Duration: 0:10:00

As your data model evolves, you'll need to update your schemas. Here are some best practices:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure new schema versions can read old data.
2. **Forward Compatibility**: Ensure old schema versions can read new data (ignoring new fields).
3. **Full Compatibility**: Aim for both backward and forward compatibility.
4. **Versioning**: Use semantic versioning for your schemas.
5. **Default Values**: Provide default values for new fields to maintain backward compatibility.
6. **Avoid Renaming**: Instead of renaming fields, add new fields and deprecate old ones.

When updating a schema in Apicurio Registry:

1. Create a new version of the existing schema.
2. Make your changes, following the best practices above.
3. Use the compatibility rule in the registry to ensure your changes don't break existing consumers.
