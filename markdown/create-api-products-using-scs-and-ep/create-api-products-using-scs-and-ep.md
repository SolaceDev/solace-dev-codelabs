# Creating Event API Products using Spring Cloud Stream, Event Portal and AsyncAPI

## Overview
Duration: 0:01:00

If your requirement is to build modern, real-time applications using event-driven architecture (EDA), this codelab will walk you through the steps of how to build Event API products, define asynchronous APIs, implement them using Spring Cloud Stream microservices, and globally distribute them across multi-cloud and on-premises environments using an Solace PubSub+ platform.

In this codelab, we will create API Products that helps others to consume Business capabilities of a _SmartTown_ where APIs are a way of life. We will also

- Learn how to define asynchronous APIs.
- Use the AsyncAPI Generator template for Spring Cloud Stream.
- Develop event-driven microservices using Spring Cloud Stream and Java.
- Connect your microservices to PubSub+ Event Brokers and stream events across the globe

Prerequisites

- Intermediate level of knowledge coding with Java
- Computer with internet connectivity

## PubSub+ Event Portal
Duration: 0:03:00

### Solace PubSub+ Event Portal

The Marketâ€™s First API Portalâ€¦for Events

[PubSub+ Event Portal](https://solace.com/blog/api-portal-for-events/) lets you design your event-driven applications, events, and schemas as interconnected network diagrams your team can go over in design reviews.

With the PubSub+ Event Portal, you can:

- Define and model event-driven systems
- Visualize existing relationships
- Develop consistent event-driven applications
- Discover and share events of interest
- Govern the event-driven system
- Integrate with 3rd-party systems for programmatic interactions
- Manage and audit changes to events, schemas, and applications
- Runtime event discovery
- Understand statistics about events


![](img/event-portal.jpg)

### Foundational Elements of PubSub+ Event Portal

![](img/event-portal-foundation.jpg)

#### Application Domain
An application domain represents a namespace where applications, events, and schemas can live. Application domains are useful to decompose the enterprise and create organizational boundaries within which teams can work. Within the application domain, you can create a suite of applications, events and schemas that are isolated from other application domains. 
#### Schema
In simple terms, a schema represents the contract to describe the payload of an event. Producers and consumers of an event can trust that the event's payload matches the schema definition assigned to that event. Schemas define a type of payload through JSON, AVRO, XML, Binary, or Text. JSON, AVRO, and XML schemas have content that describes each property of the schema. The content is either in JSON or AVRO Schema format, or XSD/DTD format.
#### Event
The event represents a business moment or an action that can be communicated with zero or more interested applications. The event is where you define metadata that describes and categorizes the event. An event is produced on a specific topic that must be defined for that event. From a modelling perspective, events reference payload schemas, and events are referenced by applications, thus forming the glue that binds applications together.

#### Application
An application represents a piece of software that produces and consumes events. Applications connect to the event broker in an event-driven architecture and communicate with other applications via events. A single application represents a class of applications that are running the same code base; therefore, there is no need to create multiple applications for each instance in a cluster.

## SmartTown - Event-Driven Design

Duration: 0:04:00

SmartTown uses information and communication technology to improve operational efficiency, share information with the public and provide a better quality of government service and citizen welfare. SmartTown uses internal microservice architecture with functionality exposed through APIs and externally exposed API products while hiding the implementation details.

![](img/smarttown-eda-design.jpg)

#### Application Domains

![](img/smarttown-topology-view.jpg)

Though the SmartTown EDA design shall encompass various aspects of automation and control - we will focus on the Analytics and Operations applications for this workshop.

#### Applications

![](img/smarttown-domain-view.jpg)

A view that captures the relationship between Applications within the Domain based on their publish/subscribe action on the domain events.
#### Events

- **TemperatureReading** - An event generated by an Temperature Sensor (IoT Device) with temperature reading and a timestamp
- **OperationalAlert** - An event generated when the temperature is found to be out of bounds with an alert type and prioritization level.

![](img/smarttown-event-view.jpg)

Positive    
: Few pointers on the implementation of the microservices in this workshop
* Temperature Sensor data generator
  * A simulator program (microservice) will be used to generate temperature reading
  * The simulation algorithm would use the current CPU load as a seed to generate temperature readings to cover wider temperature ranges
  * CPU load shall be manipulated with the use of utilities like __stress_ or others to increase the CPU load, in turn increase the temperature readings
* Alerts Generator
  * With the intent to generate alerts with priority types as
    * <= 60 - No alert required
    * 60 < Temperature <= 70 - Low Priority Alert
    * 70 < Temperature <= 80 - Medium Priority Alert
    * Temperature > 80 - High Priority Alert
* The scope of __Analytics__ in this workshop is limited to plotting the alert on a map.

### Applications List

![](img/ep-create-application-7.png)

## Event API Product

An Event API Product can be composed of events from either Solace PubSub+ Event Broker or Kafka for external developers' consumption, enabling them to build event-driven applications that can subscribe to and/or publish the specified events.

The events bundled in an Event API Product can be added from one or more application domains, so you can mix and match events. Event API is all about identifying and bundling high-value events for external consumption similar to REST APIs. 

The following diagram demonstrates the co-existence of REST & Events based APIs serving both internal and external applications.

![](img/ep-eaproduct-1.png)

When it comes to value and exposure, Event-driven applications can combine the classic system and business events to create a bundle as a specification without exposing any of the internal or implementation details. Solace PubSub+ uses AsyncAPI as the standard for API specification for exposing such Event API bundles. Consuming applications also benefits from AsyncAPI's code-generation facility to focus just on the business logic and not the mundane tasks.

## Create Event API Product

Next step in building an Event API product involves bundling of high-value, share-worthy events. The resulting bundle is released as a specification for public consumption. The generated specification is based on a commonly understood standard - like AsyncAPI. 

AsyncAPI also provides tools to generate code (supports popular languages) helping consumers directly go from spec-to-code, leaving the only responsibility of updating the business logic.

![](img/ep-eapi-product-7.png)

A newly created Event API Product can be made externally available or shared through the following methods:
- REST API
External developers can call a public REST API to retrieve this Event API Product's AsyncAPI document.
- Website
External developers can use a website to learn about your available events. Anyone with this URL can access these events.

Negative
: This Event API Productâ€™s REST API URL and Website are unavailable for external use until the Event API Product is released 

These URLs are available only when the API Product is marked as __Released__. To release the API Product, click on the __Release__ button at the top right.

More info about the API release and website hosting:

![](img/ep-eapi-product-8.png)

Positive
: Do check the __Host Website__ option to ensure that the hosted URL is publicly available. 

With this, the Event API Product named __HVAC Controller__ is ready and published for access on public URLs.

![](img/ep-eapi-product-9.png)

#### Exposed AsyncAPI URL
![](img/4-expose-to-consumer-2.jpg)

Interested parties can download the AsyncAPI specification from this public URL and build applications with minimal code using AsyncAPI codegen tools.

## AsyncAPI
Duration: 0:03:00

![](img/asyncapi-logo.png)

AsyncAPI has emerged as the industry standard for defining asynchronous, event-driven APIs; you can think of it as OpenAPI for the asynchronous world.    

It is an open source initiative that provides both 
* a specification to describe and document your asynchronous applications in a machine-readable format, and 
* tooling (such as code generators) to make life easier for developers tasked with implementing them.   

### AsyncAPI Document

An AsyncAPI document that defines the application that you want to develop. This document can be represented as JSON objects conforming to the JSON standards, or an YAML file. You can either manually create the document or use an event portal.

The AsyncAPI initiative provides a handy, interactive tool called the [AsyncAPI playground](https://playground.asyncapi.io) to make the document creation easier. 

![AsyncAPI Playground](img/asyncapi-playground.jpg)

Alternatively you can generate this document from EDA tools such as [Event Portal](https://solace.com/products/portal/) of Solace PubSub+ platform. Typically they are design-time tools allowing architects and developers to collaborate using a GUI to design the event-driven architecture. 

Having a catalog of well-organized channels and events for reuse will also save you both time and headaches while collaborating, instead of having to comb through a bunch of files in various locations.

### AsyncAPI Generator

AsyncAPI Generator is a tool that can generate a skeleton code from the AsyncAPI document, reducing the need to laboriously create boilerplate code saving time and effort.

The AsyncAPI Code Generator supports templates to generate code for a variety of different languages and protocols, but for this workshop weâ€™re going to use the [Spring Cloud Stream template](https://github.com/asyncapi/java-spring-cloud-stream-template).

The Spring Cloud Stream framework provides an easy way to get started with event-driven microservices by providing binders that allow the developer to create their microservices without having to learn messaging APIs.

```
Example:

ag ~/AsyncApiDocument.yaml https://github.com/asyncapi/java-spring-cloud-stream-template.git
```

### Coding Business Logic

The generated spring project is a regular Spring Boot Java project with generated classes under the javaPackage and an _application.yml_ file for configuration. It contains:
* Generated classes under javaPackage include POJOs defined from the schemas in the AsyncAPI document and 
* _Application.java_ which contains the actual Spring Cloud Functions to handle messages delivered on the channels as defined in the AsyncAPI document where weâ€™ll add our business logic.

## Spring Cloud Stream
Duration: 0:03:00

![Cloud Stream Intro](img/spring-cloud-logo.png)

Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for creating highly scalable, event-driven microservices connected by pluggable messaging services. Messaging services are pluggable via Binders that we'll cover in a bit. The framework is based on Spring Boot and Spring Integration.

Spring Cloud Stream has three different types of message exchange contracts as pictures below.

1. Suppliers are sources of events
1. Sinks are consumers of events
1. Processors are both consumers and subscribers of events

### Message Exchange Contracts Map to Java Functions

As of Spring Cloud Stream v3 the preferred programming model is to use Java Functions to implement your cloud stream apps.

We just mentioned the 3 types of Cloud Stream message exchange contract are "Sources", "Sinks" and "Processors".
Those map to functions as follows:

- `java.util.function.Supplier` -> Source [Producer/Publisher of Events]
- `java.util.function.Consumer` -> Sink [Subscriber/Consumer of Events]
- `java.util.function.Function` -> Processor [ Consumes, Processes, and Produces Events ]

### Binders

Spring Cloud Stream Binders are really what make the framework useful. Binders provide an abstraction layer between your code and the messaging systems over which events are flowing. This allows you to write your code without having to worry about learning messaging APIs! When messages are sent or received from the messaging system they pass through the messaging system specific binder which knows how to communicate with that specific message broker.

As of the creation of this codelab the available Cloud Stream Binders are:

- RabbitMQ
- Apache Kafka
- Amazon Kinesis
- Google PubSub
- Solace PubSub+
- Azure Event Hubs
- Apache RocketMQ

Positive
: Today we're going to use the [Solace PubSub+ Binder](https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-spring-cloud/tree/master/solace-spring-cloud-starters/solace-spring-cloud-stream-starter) which supports publish subscribe and consumer groups.

### Communication Models

Instead of having to learn Messaging APIs, developers just have to understand the communication models that Spring Cloud Stream supports. There are 3 supported models, but support varies per binder.

1. Publish-subscribe: subscribers are independent from each other & receive events in order
1. Consumer groups: fan-out and load-balancing across multiple consumers
1. Stateful partitioning support: in-order processing for consistency and performance

## Create IoT Data Simulator MicroService
Duration: 0:08:00

The directory __github/cloudstream/ac-city-iot-simulator__ contains a prebuilt spring cloud stream project that can readily publish temperature reading data. You just have to update the application.yml configuration with host details.

Import the projects under __github/cloudstream/__ directory.

###Launch Spring Tool Suite

* Open Spring Cloud Suite tool by clicking on the icon in the desktop
* Import cloud stream projects from the smarttown folder as 'Existing maven projects' 
![](img/workshop-setup-2.jpg)

###Review ___ac-city-iot-simulator___ project

####TemperatureReading.java

âœ… Review the TemperatureReading.java file. It carries temperature reading data - a simple POJO with attributes and corresponding getters/setters.

####Application.java

âœ… Review the Application.java, specifically the Supplier function.

```
  @Bean
  Supplier<Message<TemperatureReading>> publishTemperatureData()  {
    // Collect CPU metrics 
    return () -> {
      SystemInfo si = new SystemInfo();
      HardwareAbstractionLayer hal = si.getHardware();
      CentralProcessor processor = hal.getProcessor();
        
      double[] loadAverage = processor.getSystemLoadAverage(1);
          
      BigDecimal cpuLoad = new BigDecimal((loadAverage[0] < 0 ? 0 : loadAverage[0]));
      BigDecimal cpuTemp = new BigDecimal(50.0 + cpuLoad.doubleValue() * 8.0);
        
      // Construct the topic name with alert type and priority as per the Topic hierarchy design
      // SmartTown/Operations/temperatureReading/created/v1/{city}/{latitude}/{longitude}
      String topic = "SmartTown/Operations/temperatureReading/created/v1/" + city + "/" + latitude + "/" + longitude;	        			
      TemperatureReading data = new TemperatureReading(cpuLoad, city, latitude, longitude, cpuTemp);

      logger.info(data.toString());	

      // Set the target destination as the constructed topic name
      return MessageBuilder.withPayload(data)
                .setHeader(BinderHeaders.TARGET_DESTINATION, topic)
                .build();		
    };
  }	

```

âœ… The Supplier function is a Cloud Stream message exchange contract that publishes an event to configured Event Broker.

âœ… Notice the topic name construction:     

__SmartTown/Operations/temperatureReading/created/v1/{city}/{latitude}/{longitude}__

The values for variables _city, latitude_ and _longitude_ are read from the configuration file via @Value annotation.

```
    @Value("${application.latitude}")
    public BigDecimal latitude;
    @Value("${application.longitude}")
    public BigDecimal longitude;
    @Value("${application.city}")
    public String city;

```

The topic name is dynamically constructed by concatenating the root topic name and dynamic values picked up from the application configuration. 

âœ… The return value from the _Supplier_ function is a Spring Cloud Stream _Message_ that is set with destination as the dynamic topic and published to the Broker.

âœ… The temperature simulation is closely tied to CPU load on the machine, which can be manipulated using _stress_ system utility. The simulation logic is built to generate a temperature value as a multiple of CPU load.

Positive
: _stress_ utility is used to dynamically increase the CPU load, which in turn affects the simulation to produce higher temperature readings.

####application.yml

âœ… Review the application.yml

```

Positive
: Update the __host__ parameter with the Host URI noted in the previous step to connect with your Broker using Spring Cloud Stream client library.

Affect the following changes on the application configuration file:

1. Goto [Latlang.net](https://www.latlong.net) and enter your city name to get latitude and longitude values
2. In the yml file
   * Update your city name
   * Update latitude
   * Update longitude
   * Update the host name (instructor to provide the host name)
3. Save the file

####Running IoT Data Simulation

âœ… Open a terminal, change directory to ac-city-iot-simulator project and run the following maven command.
```
cd ~/github/smarttown/cloudstream/ac-city-iot-simulator
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```
This should run the simulator microservice and publish temperature reading events to the Event Broker.

## Create Alert Generator Microservice
Duration: 0:10:00

Before we proceed, we have to make minor changes to the AsyncAPI yml file. The yml file is located under __~/github/smarttown/cloudstream/__ directory (the last step in ___Download AsyncAPI Document___).

âœ… Make the following updates to the asyncapi.yaml file

Let's add a few of the template's configuration options to the download AsyncAPI document.

Add x-scs-function-name: processTemperatureReading under the subscribe operation and the publish operation under our two channels. By adding this you are telling the generator the name of the function you would like to handle events being exchanged and by adding the same function-name for both the subscribe and the publish operation you are saying you want them handled by the same function!

```
Append the line below 

      x-scs-function-name: processTemperatureReading

a) After 

channels:
  SmartTown/Operations/OperationalAlert/created/v1/{AlertPriority}/{AlertType}:
    subscribe:

b) And after

  SmartTown/Operations/temperatureReading/created/v1/{city}/{latitude}/{longitude}:
    publish:
```

With this change, the channels section of the YAML file will look like this
```
channels:
  SmartTown/Operations/OperationalAlert/created/v1/{AlertPriority}/{AlertType}:
    subscribe:
      x-scs-function-name: processTemperatureReading
      message:
        $ref: "#/components/messages/OperationalAlert"
    parameters:
      AlertType:
        schema:
          type: "string"
      AlertPriority:
        schema:
          type: "string"
  SmartTown/Operations/temperatureReading/created/v1/{city}/{latitude}/{longitude}:
    publish:
      x-scs-function-name: processTemperatureReading
      message:
        $ref: "#/components/messages/TemperatureReading"
    parameters:
      city:
        schema:
          type: "string"
      latitude:
        schema:
          type: "string"
      longitude:
        schema:
          type: "string"
```

In the last section of the yml file, in the info section remove the `x-view: "provider"`.  
```
info:
  x-generated-time: "2021-09-30 13:15 UTC"
  description: ""
  title: "HVAC Controller"
  x-view: "provider"
  version: "1"
```
With this change, info section of the YAML file will look like this

```
info:
  x-generated-time: "2021-09-30 13:15 UTC"
  description: ""
  title: "HVAC Controller"
  version: "1"
```

âœ… Save the asyncapi.yaml file

We will be building this microservice using AsyncAPI Generator tool from the AsyncAPI document hosted by the PubSub+ Event Portal.

Positive
: A file with required changes is made available in the folder by name __reference.yml__ for your reference.      

###Generate code using AsyncAPI Code Generator

âœ… Change directory to cloudstream and run the following command

```
cd ~/github/smarttown/cloudstream
```

Run the following command to invoke AsyncAPI code generator utility.

Negative
: Be sure to update the host URI in the __-p host__ parameter with the host URL noted from the Spring Cloud Stream connection settings in the previous section.     

``` 
ag -o ac-city-alert-generator -p view=provider -p binder=solace -p dynamicType=header -p artifactId=ac-city-alert-generator  -p groupId=com.eap -p javaPackage=com.eap.scs.asyncapi.alertgenerator -p host=tcps://mrri685heajs7.messaging.solace.cloud:55443 -p username=smarttown -p password=smarttown -p msgVpn=solace-eap asyncapi.yaml @asyncapi/java-spring-cloud-stream-template --force-write
```

This command will take some time (minute or so) and complete with the following message.

```
Done! âœ¨
Check out your shiny new generated files at /home/ubuntu/github/smarttown/cloudstream/ac-city-alert-generator.
```

####TemperatureReading.java

âœ… Review the TemperatureReading.java file. It carries temperature reading data - a simple POJO with attributes and corresponding getters/setters. 

It is same as the TemperatureReading POJO present in the ac-city-iot-simulator microservice.

####OperationalAlert.java

âœ… Review the OperationalAlert.java file. It carries operational alert data - a simple POJO with attributes and corresponding getters/setters. 

####Application.java

âœ… Review the Application.java, specifically the Supplier function.

Let us review the Function
```
@Bean
  public Function<TemperatureReading, Message<OperationalAlert>> processTemperatureReading() {
    return data -> {
      // Add business logic here.
      logger.info(data.toString());
      String alertType = "string";
      String alertPriority = "string";
      String topic = String.format("SmartTown/Operations/OperationalAlert/created/v1/%s/%s",
        alertType, alertPriority);
      OperationalAlert payload = new OperationalAlert();
      Message message = MessageBuilder
        .withPayload(payload)
        .setHeader(BinderHeaders.TARGET_DESTINATION, topic)
        .build();

      return message;
    };
  }
```

This Spring Cloud Stream _Function_ contract is a processor that subscribes to __TemperatureReading__ message, and publishes a __OperationalAlert__ message. 

The business logic of what transpires in this function is something we will be coding here. Our goal is to generate Alerts of HighTemperature type with three distinct priority levels:
* LOW: When temperature > 60 and <= 70
* MEDIUM: When temperature > 70 and <= 80
* HIGH: When temperature > 80

With the updated logic, the Function contract will be
```
@Bean
public Function<TemperatureReading, Message<OperationalAlert>> processTemperatureReading() {
  return data -> {
    // NOTE: A return value of null indicates that no message will be published to the Broker 
    if (data.getMCpuTemp().doubleValue() <= 60)
      return null;
    
    // Since the goal is to generate temperature alerts, set the alertType to a 
    // default value of 'HighTemperature' 
    String alertType = "HighTemperature"; // HighCpuLoad
    
    // Based on the defined bounds for Low, Medium and High temperature,
    // check the incoming temperature reading and set the alert priority appropriately
    String alertPriority = "High";
    if (data.getMCpuTemp().doubleValue() > 60 && data.getMCpuTemp().doubleValue() <= 70)
      alertPriority = "Low";
    else if (data.getMCpuTemp().doubleValue() > 70 && data.getMCpuTemp().doubleValue() <= 80)
      alertPriority = "Medium";
    
    // Construct the topic name with alert type and priority as per the Topic hierarchy design
    //		SmartTown/Operations/OperationalAlert/created/v1/{AlertPriority}/{AlertType}
    String topic = String.format("SmartTown/Operations/OperationalAlert/created/v1/%s/%s",
      alertType, alertPriority);
    
    // Construct an OperatinalAlert object 
    OperationalAlert payload = new OperationalAlert(alertPriority, alertType, data.getMCity(), data.getMCpuTemp(), 
                            data.getMLatitude(), data.getMLongitude());
    
    logger.info("Operational Alert: \n" + payload.toString());
    

    // Add OperationalAlert as type parameter to Message declaration (AsyncAPI codegen will fix this soon)
    Message<OperationalAlert> message = MessageBuilder
      .withPayload(payload)
      .setHeader(BinderHeaders.TARGET_DESTINATION, topic)
      .build();

    return message;
  };
}
```

There could be other internal services like monitor and external applications like analytics, dashboard could subscribe to this Alert event.

âœ… Notice the topic name construction:     

__SmartTown/Operations/OperationalAlert/created/v1/{AlertPriority}/{AlertType}__

The topic name is dynamically constructed by concatenating the root topic name and computed values for _AlertPriority_, and _AlertType_ . 

âœ… The return value from the _Function_ function is a Spring Cloud Stream _Message_ that is set with destination as the dynamic topic and published to the Broker.

âœ… The temperature simulation is closely tied to CPU load on the machine, which can be manipulated using _stress_ system utility. The simulation logic is built to generate a temperature value as a multiple of CPU load.

####application.yml

Positive
: 1. Before you proceed, make sure that you have received connection details for the Solace PubSub+ Event Broker from the instructor and keep it handy.

Positive
: 2. Note the City name you used in the ac-city-iot-simulator microservice, as you would want to use the same city name to subscribe to TemperatureReading events. Otherwise, this microservice will end up receiving TemperatureReading events from all cities.


âœ… Review the application.yml

## Simulate Temperature Variation
Duration: 0:05:00


#### Running IoT Data Simulation

âœ… Open a terminal, change directory to ac-city-iot-simulator project and run the following maven command.
```
cd ~/github/smarttown/cloudstream/ac-city-iot-simulator
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```
This should run the simulator microservice and publish temperature reading events to the Event Broker.

####Running Alert Generator

âœ… Open a terminal, change directory to ac-city-alert-generator project and run the following maven command.
```
cd ~/github/smarttown/cloudstream/ac-city-iot-generator
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

This should run the alert generator microservice that subscribes to temperature reading event and publish appropriate operational alert  events to the Event Broker.

This should run the simulator microservice and publish temperature reading events to the Event Broker.

####Simulating CPU load to generate 

âœ… Open a terminal, change directory to ac-city-alert-generator project and run the following maven command.

Positive
: _stress_ utility is used to dynamically increase the CPU load, which in turn affects the simulation to produce higher temperature readings.     

To run the stress command, type:    

```
stress -c 6 -t 180  -v    
```

__Hint:__ Simulate load on CPU with 6 worker threads and exit after 180 seconds.   

This will simulate load on the VM and till timeout after 180 seconds. As the CPU load varies, it gets translated to temperature variation in the Alert Generator microservice and the readings gets tagged as Low, Medium or High severity appropriately.     

Observe that the alerts generated are qualified with Low, High and Medium severity types appropriately as the CPU Load varies.
## Alert Aggregator (optional)
Duration: 0:08:00

We will extend the workshop to generate an aggregated alert (over a period/duration of 30 seconds) with average temperature and alert nature. In turn these aggregated alerts will be subscribed by a web application using MQTT client in Javascript and plots geo-location markers on Google Maps. 

To accomplish that, we would extend the EDA design:
* Create a Schema `AggregateAlert`
* Create a Event `AggregateAlert`
* Create Application `Heating Cooling Controllers - DASHBOARD` and set appropriate permissions

###Create Schema - ___AggregateAlert___

âœ… Create schema __AggregateAlert__ under ___Smart - Analytics___ Application  

![](img/ep-create-schema-11.png)

âœ… Launch create schema page

## Alert Dashboard (optional)

###Review ___ac-city-alert-dashboard___ project

Alert Dashboard is a Spring Boot Application that serves static web application with HTML pages & JS scripts. The web application makes a MQTT client connection to the Broker and subscribes to ___AggregateAlert___ event, on receipt it simply plots them on the Google Map. 

A tooltip facility details the alert nature with information on timestamp, temperature, sample size, city name and geo-coordinates.

âœ… Review the shared.js

The connection details to establish a MQTT client session is retrieved from the following page.



```
  // eclipse test server
  var deets = {
    host: 'mrri685heajs7.messaging.solace.cloud',
    port: 8443,
    ssl: true,
    username: 'smarttown',
    password: 'smarttown',
  }
  
  var topicName = 'SmartTown/Operations/AggregateAlert/created/v1/+/+/+';
  var windowSizeSecs = 10000;

  // this is for MQTT, it should return a connected or connecting valid Paho client
  function getClientConnection(uniqueID,onMessageArrived,onConnectionLost,onConnect) {
    var client = new Paho.MQTT.Client(deets['host'], Number(deets['port']), uniqueID); // AWS SGP Nano
    // set the callback handlers
    client.onConnectionLost = onConnectionLost;
    client.onMessageArrived = onMessageArrived;
    // define connection options
    var connectOptions = {};
    if (deets['ssl'] == true) {
      connectOptions["useSSL"] = true;
    } else {
      connectOptions["useSSL"] = false;
    }
    //connectOptions["reconnect"] = true;
    connectOptions["userName"] = deets['username'];
    connectOptions["password"] = deets['password'];  // AWS SGP Nano
    connectOptions["onSuccess"] = onConnect;
    // try to connect!
    client.connect(connectOptions);
    return client;
  }

```

MQTT client connection is established with the Broker.

## Takeaways

Duration: 0:01:00

- âœ… The [Solace PubSub+ Event Portal](solace.com/products/portal) is an excellent tool to design and visualize your Event-Driven Architecture, discover what events exist, collaborate with your team and kickstart development via exporting of AsyncAPI documents.
- âœ… [AsyncAPI Generator](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator) templates allow developers to consistently create event-driven applications by generating code skeletons that are pre-wired with the events and channels defined in the AsyncAPI documents.
- âœ… [Spring Cloud Stream](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-stream) allows developers to implement highly scalable, event-driven microservices without having to learn how to use messaging APIs.
