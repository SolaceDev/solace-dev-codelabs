### Problem statement
Building effective agentic systems presents a complex challenge that extends far beyond simply deploying AI models. AI Agents are siloed systems that operate in isolation, and are unable to effectively communicate or share capabilities across organizational boundaries. **By definition and design, Agents are inherently domain-specific, designed to excel in narrow use cases but struggling to collaborate or leverage expertise from other specialized agents, creating fragmented AI ecosystems that fail to realize their collective potential.**

![Fragmented](img/fragmented_ai_agents_silos.png)


To make intelligent decisions and respond to dynamic conditions, agentic systems must rely on event-driven actions that flow into the organization. While solving the core AI challenge represents only 20% of the effort, the remaining 80% involves the much more complex task of connecting AI models to the disparate data sources, legacy systems, APIs, and organizational knowledge that exist across isolated silos—making data accessibility and integration the true bottleneck in delivering practical AI value

The system's comprehensive observability allows teams to analyze interaction patterns between agents, measure performance of different collaboration strategies, and identify bottlenecks or failure modes in complex multi-agent systems. Academic and commercial research groups implement these environments to develop new frameworks for agent cooperation, test emergent behaviors in multi-agent systems, and evaluate different approaches to task decomposition and delegation between specialized AI capabilities.

### Natural Language Data Intelligence
Data analysis teams implement agents that query databases, transform results, and generate visualizations based on natural language requests, making complex data accessible to non-technical users throughout organizations. These implementations translate ambiguous human queries into precise database operations, apply appropriate transformations to the retrieved data, and automatically select visualization approaches that best communicate the insights. Organizations deploy these systems to democratize data access, allowing business users to interact with complex data warehouses through conversational interfaces while maintaining governance controls through the mesh's robust permission system and generating consistent, properly formatted outputs regardless of query complexity.


### Enterprise Integration
Solace Agent Mesh demonstrates significant value in providing AI-powered integration between enterprise systems like Jira, Confluence, and other corporate knowledge bases and workflow tools. These implementations connect previously siloed information systems through intelligent agents that understand cross-system relationships, can translate between different data models, and maintain context across system boundaries. Organizations implement these integrations to reduce manual data transfer between systems, ensure consistency of information across platforms, and provide unified natural language interfaces to multiple backend systems, significantly improving knowledge worker productivity and information accuracy across the enterprise.

### Agent Cards in the A2A Specification

Agent Cards are a critical component of the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol specification. They serve as the "identity" and capability declaration for agents in a distributed system.

### What Are Agent Cards?

An Agent Card is a document (in JSON format) that describes an agent's:
- Identity (name, description, version)
- Capabilities (what the agent can do)
- Skills (specific functions or abilities)
- Service endpoint URL (how to reach the agent)
- Authentication requirements (how to authenticate)
- Interaction protocols (how to communicate)

Agent Cards enable agents to discover each other and understand how to interact appropriately. They are the foundation of the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol that Solace Agent Mesh implements.

### Agent Card Structure

In the Solace Agent Mesh YAML configuration, the agent card is defined within the `agent_card` section of the agent's configuration file. Internally, this is translated to a JSON document that follows the A2A specification.

The agent card includes:

1. **Basic Metadata**
   - `description`: A human-readable description of the agent's purpose
   - `defaultInputModes`: Formats the agent accepts as input (e.g., "text", "image")
   - `defaultOutputModes`: Formats the agent produces as output

2. **Skills Section**
   - Lists the specific capabilities or services the agent offers
   - Each skill has an ID, name, and description
   - Skills are discoverable by other agents for delegation and collaboration

3. **Authentication Information** (optional)
   - Methods for authenticating with the agent
   - Required scopes or permissions

4. **Capabilities Declaration** (optional)
   - Special features the agent supports (streaming, attachments, etc.)
   - Extension capabilities beyond core A2A functionality

### Benefits of the YAML Configuration Approach

The YAML-based configuration approach in Solace Agent Mesh provides several key benefits:

1. **Configuration-driven:** Precise control over agent behavior, service integrations, and security settings without code changes
2. **Security-first approach:** Built-in authorization framework with fine-grained access control
3. **Resilient by nature:** Event-driven design creates responsive, self-healing interactions
4. **Standardized discovery:** A2A-compliant agent cards enable seamless agent integration and collaboration

This configuration approach is particularly valuable for building complex multi-agent systems where agents need to discover and collaborate with each other based on their respective capabilities and skills.


## Built-in tools
Duration: 0:07:00

Built-in tools in the Solace Agent Mesh are a comprehensive set of capabilities that enable agents to perform complex tasks, interact with various systems, and collaborate effectively within the mesh ecosystem. These tools extends the native capabilities offered by the [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/). This of these tool as native functionalities that agents have access to like "functions" instead of building these from scratch. 

The Solace Agent Mesh comes with a series of built-in tools natively to the platform. Each built-in tool name is defined in the `tools` section of the application configuration for the agent in the yaml config file as follows

```yaml
tools:
   - tool_type: builtin
     tool_name: "tool_name"
```
> aside positive
> Note that this is a developing open source framework and more built-in tools will be developed and introduced. Learn more about the available tools from the [Built-in Tool documentation](https://solacelabs.github.io/solace-agent-mesh/docs/documentation/user-guide/builtin-tools/)

**1. Artifact Management Tools**

Artifact management tools handle the creation, storage, and retrieval of content and data objects across the agent ecosystem. They ensure artifacts such as documents, code, or structured data can be versioned, shared, and persistently stored while also supporting format conversion for interoperability. These tools make it easier for agents to generate and reuse artifacts seamlessly.

**2. Data Analysis Tools**

Data analysis tools allow agents to process, transform, and analyze data from a variety of sources. They support statistical analysis, natural language processing, and visualization generation, enabling agents to extract insights from both structured and unstructured data. With built-in query functions, these tools can also handle natural language queries against different data stores.

**3. Web Tools**

Web tools empower agents to interact directly with web-based resources and services. They support sending HTTP requests, retrieving and parsing content, and integrating with APIs while managing authentication methods like OAuth or API keys. In permitted cases, they also enable web scraping and structured response handling.

**4. Peer Agent Delegation Tools**

Peer agent delegation tools make collaboration among agents more efficient by supporting the distribution of tasks across specialized agents. They allow context to be shared, results to be aggregated, and coordination strategies to be applied, whether sequential, parallel, or conditional. These tools also enable agents to discover expertise and provide feedback to one another.

**5. Developer Tools**

Developer tools help streamline the development, deployment, and maintenance of the agent mesh. They include command-line utilities for management, debugging interfaces for real-time monitoring, and configuration management systems for precise control. Additionally, observability and testing frameworks provide insights into system health and validation of agent performance.

**6. System Integration Tools**

System integration tools connect agents with external backend systems and enterprise platforms. They provide connectors to databases, event streams, and message queues while also allowing controlled file system access. These tools extend the mesh’s capabilities by integrating AI models and external enterprise applications into agent workflows.


Lets take an example for a `web-request` agent

```yaml
- name: web_agent_app
    app_base_path: .
    app_module: solace_agent_mesh.agent.sac.app
    broker:
      <<: *broker_connection

    app_config:
      namespace: ${NAMESPACE}
      supports_streaming: true
      agent_name: "WebAgent"
      display_name: "Web Content"
      model: *planning_model # Or another appropriate model from shared_config.yaml
      instruction: |
        You are an agent that can fetch content from web URLs using the 'web_request' tool.
        You can make various types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) and include custom headers or a body.
        The tool will return the fetched content (HTML converted to Markdown, other text types as is, or raw binary data).
        You will then need to process this content based on the user's request.
        Always save useful fetched content as an artifact.

      tools:
        - tool_type: builtin
          tool_name: "web_request"
        - tool_type: builtin-group
          group_name: "artifact_management"
```

This yaml configuration of a Web Agent uses two types of tools: a built-in tool `web_request` that handles web requests and a group of built-in tools `artifact_management` that handles artifact access 

## Plugins Ecosystem
Duration: 0:10:00


Plugins serve as the backbone of the Solace Agent Mesh extensible architecture, providing a structured way to package, distribute, and incorporate new features into any SAM deployment. They are modular Python packages that extend the agent mesh's capabilities through specialized components that integrate seamlessly with the A2A protocol.

To spin up the list of the core plugins offered by the Solace Agent Mesh, execute the following

```
sam plugin catalog
```
![simpleFlow](img/plugincat.png)

### Types of plugins
Solace Agent Mesh supports three primary categories of plugins, each serving different purposes within the ecosystem:

**Agent Plugins**
These contain specialized agents with domain-specific capabilities. They extend the system's ability to perform specific tasks or interact with particular data sources or services. For example, an agent plugin might specialize in processing financial data or analyzing medical imagery.

**Gateway Plugins**
These provide new interface types for external system integration, enabling SAM to connect with various user interfaces, APIs, or communication channels. Gateway plugins might add support for channels like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or custom web interfaces.

**Custom Plugins**
These implement specialized integrations that don't fit neatly into the agent or gateway categories. Examples include connectors for specific enterprise systems, data transformation services, or security extensions.

### Where to get plugins?

The Solace Agent Mesh ecosystem encompasses both official and community-developed plugins:

## Adding MCP Agents
Duration: 0:05:00

As mentioned earlier, the Solace Agent Mesh is an agent agnostic framework. Agents are YAML configuration driven and can be authored using 

In this step, we are going to add an MCP agent using the graphical user interface.

From your terminal instance, execute this command from your terminal

```
sam add agent --gui
```

Let's go ahead and add an MCP agent that executes filesystem operations such as read/write, create files, get list of files, and searching directories. Learn more about this MCP agent from the [Filesystem MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem) found in the official list of open source MCP servers

Fill in the following information with the following instructions
```
You can interact with the local filesystem using MCP tools. Use the available tools to read, write, and manage files as requested.
```

![SAM final](img/addagentinit.png)

Select the service. Note you can leave everything default here
![service](img/service.png)

Features is a list of A2A specific features that can extend the functionalities of your agent (in this example an MCP agent) to expose A2A features to it. Keep everything default here
![features](img/features.png)


In this step, you will have to define the list of tools and skills this agent has. As mentioned in a previous step, tools could be built-in from the Solace Agent Mesh or you can specify a list of tools that are exposed from an MCP serve. 
![customtools](img/customtools.png)

Go ahead and click the `Add Tool` button
![addtool](img/addtool.png)

You can see here there a list of different kind of tools to add. Go ahead and click on the MCP Tool 

![MCPTool](img/MCPTool.png)

Under the Connection Parameters, add the following 

```JSON
{
  "type": "stdio",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp/samv2"]
}

```

> aside positive
> In this example, we are using a stdio connection as the `type` to connect to an MCP server running as a local process. There are different types of connections including SSE (server sent events) to a remote MCP server, docker for a containerized MCP server, and other types as this connection evolves

> aside positive
> Note: you can replace `/tmp/samv2` with any directory of your choice

Click the `Add Tool`. Notice how this new agent now has two types of custom tools
1. Artifact Management: This is a group of Solace Agent Mesh built-in tools that extends the capabilities of the custom agent
1. MCP: All the tools that are defined in the MCP server exposed as custom tools for the agent

Click `Next`

You are then prompted with the Agent Card dialog. 
![agentCard](img/agentCard.png)

Add the following Agent Card Description

```
An agent that interacts with the local filesystem via MCP.
```

Leave everything else as the default. Click `Next`.

![agentReview](img/agentReview.png)

🎉 Click `Save Agent & Finish` and you're done! You now have a custom MCP Agent configured.

This process created a yaml configuration file under `configs/agents/file_system_agent.yaml`. I want to point to your attention to this section of the configuration

```yaml
tools: 
   - group_name: artifact_management
      tool_type: builtin-group
   - connection_params:
      args:
      - -y
      - '@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem'
      - /tmp/samv2
      command: npx
      timeout: 30
      type: stdio
      tool_type: mcp
```
You can see here that this agent has two types of tools: the built-in tools and an MCP configuration. 

The full yaml configuration for the agent should look like this

```yaml
# Solace Agent Mesh Agent Configuration

log:
  stdout_log_level: INFO
  log_file_level: DEBUG
  log_file: a2a_agent.log

!include ../shared_config.yaml

    app_config:
      namespace: "${NAMESPACE}"
      supports_streaming: true
      agent_name: "FileSystem"
      display_name: "File System Agent"
      model: *general_model 

      instruction: |
        You can interact with the local filesystem using MCP tools. Use the available tools to read, write, and manage files as requested.
      
      tools: 
        - group_name: artifact_management
          tool_type: builtin-group
        - connection_params:

            - -y
            - '@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem'
            - /tmp/samv2
            command: npx
            timeout: 30
            type: stdio
          tool_type: mcp

      session_service: 
        type: "sql"
        default_behavior: "PERSISTENT"
        database_url: "${FILE_SYSTEM_DATABASE_URL}"
      artifact_service: *default_artifact_service
      
      artifact_handling_mode: "reference"
      enable_embed_resolution: true
      enable_artifact_content_instruction: true
      data_tools_config: *default_data_tools_config

      # Agent Card Definition
      agent_card:
        description: |
          An agent that interacts with the local filesystem via MCP.
        defaultInputModes: [text] 
        defaultOutputModes: [text, file] 
        skills: []
      
      # Discovery & Communication
      agent_card_publishing: 
        interval_seconds: 10
      agent_discovery: 
        enabled: true
      inter_agent_communication:
        allow_list: ["*"] 
        deny_list: [] 
        request_timeout_seconds: 600
```

Now go ahead and run an instance of the solace agent mesh from your terminal in your root project directory
```
sam run
```
Navigate to the Agents tab and see the new agent in the list

![fileagent](img/fileagent.png)

Now that you have the File Agent up and running, you can run any of the following prompts to see it in action

```
"List the files in the directory"
"Create a simple text file with some content"
"Read the contents of test.txt"
```
