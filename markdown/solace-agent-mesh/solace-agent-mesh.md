### Problem statement
Building effective agentic systems presents a complex challenge that extends far beyond simply deploying AI models. AI Agents are siloed that operate in isolation, and are unable to effectively communicate or share capabilities across organizational boundaries. By definition and design, Agents are inherently domain-specific, designed to excel in narrow use cases but struggling to collaborate or leverage expertise from other specialized agents, creating fragmented AI ecosystems that fail to realize their collective potential.

To make intelligent decisions and respond to dynamic conditions, agentic systems must rely on event-driven actions that flow into the organization. While solving the core AI challenge represents only 20% of the effort, the remaining 80% involves the much more complex task of connecting AI models to the disparate data sources, legacy systems, APIs, and organizational knowledge that exist across isolated silosâ€”making data accessibility and integration the true bottleneck in delivering practical AI value

## Google Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)
Duration: 0:07:00

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol is Google's standardized communication protocol designed to enable seamless interaction between AI agents, regardless of their underlying implementation or hosting environment. It provides a common language for agents to discover each other, exchange information, delegate tasks, and collaborate on complex problems. This document explores the A2A protocol in detail, including its design principles, components, and implementation approaches.

> aside positive
> A2A is an open-source protocol, available for any developer or organization to implement. This open nature fosters a rich ecosystem of interoperable agents across different platforms and frameworks.

### Core Concepts

The A2A Protocol is built around several foundational concepts that define its structure and behavior:

#### Protocol Design Principles

A2A was designed with the following principles in mind:

1. **Standardization**: Provide a common interface for agent communication
2. **Interoperability**: Enable agents from different systems to work together
3. **Extensibility**: Support evolving agent capabilities
4. **Asynchronicity**: Handle long-running tasks and parallel operations
5. **Discoverability**: Allow agents to find and understand each other's capabilities
6. **Security**: Implement robust authentication and authorization

These principles ensure that A2A serves as a reliable foundation for building multi-agent systems.

#### Agent Cards

Agent Cards are metadata structures that describe an agent's capabilities, allowing other agents and systems to discover and understand how to interact with them. Key components include:

1. **Name**: A unique identifier for the agent
2. **Description**: A human-readable explanation of the agent's purpose
3. **Capabilities**: The specific tasks the agent can perform
4. **Input/Output Formats**: The data structures the agent expects and produces
5. **Authentication Requirements**: Security information for accessing the agent

Agent Cards are published to discovery endpoints, making them available to other agents in the ecosystem.

> aside negative
> Always validate Agent Cards from external sources, as malicious actors could potentially publish misleading Agent Cards to trick systems into inappropriate delegations.

#### Tasks

Tasks represent the work that agents perform. They include:

1. **Task ID**: A unique identifier for tracking
2. **Input**: The information provided to the agent
3. **Context**: Additional information about the task environment
4. **Artifacts**: Files or binary data associated with the task
5. **Delegation Path**: Information about how the task was routed

Tasks follow a lifecycle from creation through processing to completion or failure.

#### Events

Events represent the state changes and progress updates that occur during task execution:

1. **Status Updates**: Progress information about ongoing tasks
2. **Artifact Updates**: Notifications about new or modified files
3. **Error Events**: Information about failures or issues
4. **Completion Events**: Signals that a task has finished

Events enable asynchronous monitoring of task progress, which is essential for long-running operations.

#### Artifacts

Artifacts are files or binary data that agents can exchange:

1. **Content**: The actual data (text, image, audio, etc.)
2. **Metadata**: Information about the artifact (type, creation time, etc.)
3. **Versioning**: Tracking changes to artifacts over time
4. **References**: Ways to refer to artifacts across the system

Artifacts enable agents to share rich, structured data beyond simple text messages.

> aside positive
> The A2A Protocol continues to evolve with the needs of the agent ecosystem. 

### Where to learn more 

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol provides a standardized foundation for building interconnected AI agent systems. By enabling discovery, task delegation, and asynchronous communication, A2A facilitates the creation of sophisticated multi-agent workflows that can tackle complex problems through collaboration.

As the ecosystem of AI agents continues to grow, A2A offers a common language that allows these agents to work together seamlessly, regardless of their underlying implementation or hosting environment. This interoperability is key to unlocking the full potential of agent-based AI systems.

## Agent Development Kit (ADK)
Duration: 0:05:00

Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) offers developers a comprehensive framework to build, evaluate, and deploy sophisticated AI agents with minimal friction. ADK provides the essential building blocksâ€”from LLM integration and tool execution to session management and artifact handlingâ€”that enable both conversational and non-conversational agents capable of complex reasoning, planning, and task execution. 

The A2A Protocol works seamlessly with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK):

1. **ADK A2A Tools**: Built-in tools for A2A communication
2. **Protocol Translation**: Converting between ADK events and A2A messages
3. **Agent Deployment**: Exposing ADK agents through A2A endpoints
4. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Building networks of ADK agents communicating via A2A

For more information on ADK integration, see the [ADK documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/).
