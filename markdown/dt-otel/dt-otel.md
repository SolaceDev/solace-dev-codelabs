# Getting Started with Solace Distributed Tracing and Context Propagation

## What you'll learn: Overview
This CodeLabs will take you through the basics of the new distributed tracing feature. Following these steps will take you through:
* Launching and configuring a PubSub+ Event Broker Software
* Launching the OpenTelemetry Collector configured to use Solace modules
* Launching Jaeger which offers a user interface to view traced events
* Publishing and receiving messages to/from your broker to generate broker trace events
* Using auto-instrumented JMS application that will generate end to end linked traces (publisher ‚Äì broker ‚Äì receiver traces)
  
Upon successful completion of this Code Labs, we encourage you to experiment with distributed tracing and the environment provided to see how it fits with your use case(s). This can include other message sources, Open Telemetry exporters, and telemetry analysis tools. Please note that as a Demo feature using a standard broker edition release there are some restrictions.

### Limitations and caveats
For this release, trace events will be generated for published messages (guaranteed and promoted direct) upon broker receipt and when the message is enqueued by the broker. This release supports context propagation to link traces for the same message from multiple sources.

This codelabs project is provided for demonstration purposes only. The sample applications included herein (solace-publisher and solace-queue-receiver), the configuration, and the setup scripts are not intended for general use, nor do they contain necessary certificates, or configuration for a secure session connection. As such they should only be used in a local environment for feature demonstration purposes only.
Please contact your SE for support.

## What you need: Prerequisites

### Docker
This CodeLabs relies on the use of Docker. If you do not already have Docker installed, you will first need to do that. Docker Desktop can be installed  for ease of use. At least 4 GiB and 2 cores should be made available for Docker. If more physical resources are available, providing more may improve your experience (e.g. 8 GiB and 4 cores).

### Java

This CodeLabs relies on the features found in modern Java JRE version (Open JDK or Oracle JDK when appropriate license is available by user). For this demo you must have Java 16 or higher.

To validate that Java is correctly installed on your system type following commands in your console:

```console
[solace@dev ~]$ java -version
```

If Java is correctly installed on your machine this will be printed indicating a vendor and the version of the Java installed on your machine.

```console
[solace@dev ~]$ java -version
openjdk version "16" 2021-03-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 16+36-2231)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 16+36-2231, mixed mode, sharing)
```

### Downloading the tracing-codelab package
The tracing-codelab package contains/require the following items:
* docker-compose.yaml (Docker images will be downloaded by Docker environment upon first launch from a Docker hub):
  * Docker image of the Solace PubSub+ Event Broker
  * Docker image of the [OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) packaged with a Solace receiver modules
  * Docker Image for the Jaeger all in one
* otel-collector-config.yaml
* solace_config_keys.env
* .env (file with environment variables used in a docker compose files)
* solace-publisher.jar (command line Solace jms application for publishing of messages)
* solace-queue-receiver.jar (command line Solace jms application for receiving of messages from a JMS Queue)
* opentelemetry-javaagent-all-\<version\>.jar OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation API 
* solace-opentelemetry-jms-integration-\<version\>.jar [Solace PubSub+ OpenTelemetry Integration API for JMS](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/solace/solace-opentelemetry-jms-integration/1.0.0/solace-opentelemetry-jms-integration-1.0.0.jar)
* jms-auto-instrumentation-sampler-sources.jar (Source code for the Solace jms application for publishing and receiving messages) 

You will be able to download the following package from the Solace product [download site](https://products.solace.com/download/COMMUNITY_CODELABS_TRACING) 

When extracting from this archive, it is mandatory that there are no SPACES in the full path to the working directory.

```console
[solace@dev ~]$ unzip tracing-codelab-1.0.zip
[solace@dev ~]$ cd tracing-codelab
```

###  Creating and launching the containers

The following command will download and launch all containers necessary for the codelab (Internet access will be required to download images from Docker hub).

```console
[solace@dev tracing-codelab]$ docker compose up -d

*NOTE:* Be aware  the command demonstrated above is `docker compose` and not  `docker-compose`. Make sure to use a recent version. Both `docker compose` and `docker-compose` may be available on your system and could differ in version.

###  Few notes to the code lab configuration
The `.env` file contains several environment variables that are used within the `docker-compose.yaml` file and may need to be changed by user depends on the runtime environment: 

* Solace Pub Sub Plus broker port `55557`
* Open Telemetry contribution repository collector docker image tag and version `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.67.0`
* Solace PubSub+ broker docker image tag and version `solace/solace-pubsub-standard:10.2`

## Configuring the PubSub+ Event Broker: Software

To improve the user's exposure to the distributed tracing feature, the broker comes with minimal configuration. Here are the step-by-step instructions to configure your broker.
Please note that for simplicity's sake these steps will not go through configuring any TLS settings and as a result, most data will be exchanged in a non-secure manner.

### Accessing CLI

First you must access your container; do so by typing the following command.

```console
[solace@dev tracing-codelab]$ docker exec -it tracing-codelab-solbroker-1 /bin/bash

This Solace product is proprietary software of
Solace Corporation. By accessing this Solace product
you are agreeing to the license terms and conditions
located at http://www.solace.com/license-software
```

Once inside the container, simply type `cli`.
Note: If you are flying through the steps too quickly, you may need to give the broker a few seconds to fully initialize itself after running the `docker compose` command from the previous section before being able to access `cli` successfully.

```console
[appuser@solbroker sw]$ cli

Solace PubSub+ Standard Version 10.2.xxx

This Solace product is proprietary software of
Solace Corporation. By accessing this Solace product
you are agreeing to the license terms and conditions

Operating Mode: Message Routing Node

solbroker>
```

### Configuring the Message VPN

The following minimal configuration is **necessary** on the Message VPN. 

<aside class="negative">
‚ö†Ô∏è If these steps aren't followed, your OpenTelemetry Collector logs will show 

```console
"error": "no supported auth mechanism ([ANONYMOUS])"}.
```
This _very clear_ üôÑ message is the Collector warning you that you're trying to connect to an unsecured resource (i.e. the broker).
</aside>

The following commands will suffice.

```console
solbroker> enable
solbroker# configure
solbroker(configure)# message-vpn default
solbroker(configure/message-vpn)# authentication basic auth-type internal
solbroker(configure/message-vpn)# end
```

### Configuring the default Client Username

This Client Username will be used later for publishing messages to the broker.
```console
solbroker# configure
solbroker(configure)# client-username default message-vpn default
solbroker(configure/client-username)# password default
solbroker(configure/client-username)# end
```

### Configuring the default Client Profile

This Client Profile is used by the Client Username configured above.
```console
solbroker# configure
solbroker(configure)# client-profile default message-vpn default
solbroker(configure/client-profile)# message-spool reject-msg-to-sender-on-no-subscription-match
solbroker(configure/client-profile)# end
```

### Configuring the Telemetry Profile

The Telemetry Profile defines which published messages should be traced as well as who should be allowed to consume those trace messages.

First, start by creating the Telemetry Profile.
```console
solbroker# configure
solbroker(configure)# message-vpn default
solbroker(configure/message-vpn)# create telemetry-profile trace
```

Next, open up and enable the receiver.
```console
solbroker(configure/message-vpn/telemetry-profile)# receiver acl connect default-action allow
solbroker(configure/message-vpn/telemetry-profile)# no receiver shutdown
```

Finally, let's create a filter that will attract all topic messages (using the `>` subscription).
```console
solbroker(configure/message-vpn/telemetry-profile)# trace
solbroker(...e/message-vpn/telemetry-profile/trace)# no shutdown
solbroker(configure/message-vpn/telemetry-profile)# create filter default
solbroker(...ge-vpn/telemetry-profile/trace/filter)# no shutdown
solbroker(...ge-vpn/telemetry-profile/trace/filter)# create subscription ">"
solbroker(...try-profile/trace/filter/subscription)# end
```

When creating a Telemetry Profile, a Telemetry Queue is created. In this example, the queue name would be `#telemetry-trace` because we used `trace` as the profile name when creating the Telemetry Profile. When generated, trace messages will be added to this queue for consumption.

Also worth mentioning, creating a Telemetry Profile will also cause the broker to create a Client Profile as well as an ACL Profile. Just like the Telemetry Queue, the names of these profiles will take on the format of `#telemetry-<telemetry-profile-name>`.
These profiles must be used by the Client Username or else the Client will not be able to bind to the Telemetry Queue to consume trace messages.

Create the Client Username used by the OpenTelemetry Collector.
```console
solbroker# configure
solbroker(configure)# create client-username trace message-vpn default
solbroker(configure/client-username)# password trace
solbroker(configure/client-username)# client-profile #telemetry-trace
solbroker(configure/client-username)# acl-profile #telemetry-trace
solbroker(configure/client-username)# no shutdown
solbroker(configure/client-username)# end
```

We need to create a new Client Username for binding to the Telemetry Queue because a Client Username can only be used to bind to a Telemetry Queue if it uses both the Telemetry Client Profile and Telemetry ACL Profile. Additionally, the Telemetry Client Profile does not allow the Client to publish persistent messages.


Create a queue for attracting messages published to topic `solace/tracing`.
```console
solbroker# configure
solbroker(configure)# message-spool message-vpn default
solbroker(configure/message-spool)# create queue q
solbroker(configure/message-spool/queue)# permission all delete
solbroker(configure/message-spool/queue)# subscription topic solace/tracing
solbroker(configure/message-spool/queue)# no shutdown
solbroker(configure/message-spool/queue)# end
```

## Verifying your broker configuration

### Verifying your telemetry queue

As previously mentioned, a special Telemetry Queue should have been created when the Telemetry Profile was created.
Now that all configuration has been applied to the broker, you should see a Bind Count of "1" on your Telemetry Queue.
The client bound to the Telemetry Queue is the Solace Receiver Module, part of the OpenTelemetry Collector application that was launched in an earlier step.

```console
solbroker# show queue #telemetry-trace

Flags Legend:
I - Ingress Admin State (U=Up, D=Down)
E - Egress  Admin State (U=Up, D=Down)
A - Access-Type         (E=Exclusive, N=Non-Exclusive)
S - Selector            (Y=Yes, N=No)
R - Redundancy          (P=Primary, B=Backup)
D - Durability          (D=Durable, N=Non-Durable)
P - Priority            (Y=Yes, N=No)

Queue Name                   Messages      Spool             Bind Status

```

## Producing trace messages and accessing trace span in Jaeger

### Publishing messages using a simple jms application

We have provided a simple JMS publishing application in `solace-publisher.jar`.  
As you follow the steps in this codelab don‚Äôt forget to replace the IP address in the command with your system's IP address if docker compose is not running on a same host.

If Docker is running on the same system (which is expected) where you are running solace-publisher, you can use the following command:

```console
[solace@dev tracing-codelab]$ 
java -Dsolace.host=localhost:55557 -Dsolace.vpn=default -Dsolace.user=default -Dsolace.password=default -Dsolace.topic=solace/tracing -jar solace-publisher.jar
```

### Jaeger UI

As part of an earlier step, the Jaeger UI was launched. It can be accessed using your favourite browser.

If Docker is running on the same system your browser is running on, you can access the Jaeger UI using the following URI: [http://0.0.0.0:16686/](http://0.0.0.0:16686/) or [http://localhost:16686/](http://localhost:16686/).
If Docker is running on another system in your network, simply replace `0.0.0.0` to the system's IP, e.g. `http://192.168.3.166:16686/`.

### Verify published messages are traced in the Jaeger UI

After the OpenTelemetry Collector has received a message, you should be able to see the solbroker trace. Once the right service has been selected, select "Find Traces" button.
![Jaeger1](img/jaeger1.png)

You should now see a trace for the message published using solace-publisher from the previous step.
![Jaeger2](img/jaeger2.png)

To view more details about this trace, click on it. You can then expand various boxes so that more information is displayed.
![Jaeger3](img/jaeger3.png)


## Jaeger UI - Searching for traces

### Publishing more interesting messages

Let's publish three messages with user properties so that we can search for them on Jaeger. The messages will contain the following {key,value} pairs.

1. {myKey,myValue1}
2. {myKey,myValue2}
3. {myKey,myValue3} 

```console
java -Dsolace.user-properties=‚ÄúmyKey=myValue1‚Äù -Dsolace.host=localhost:55557 -Dsolace.vpn=default -Dsolace.user=default -Dsolace.password=default -Dsolace.topic=solace/tracing -jar solace-publisher.jar
java -Dsolace.user-properties=‚ÄúmyKey=myValue2‚Äù -Dsolace.host=localhost:55557 -Dsolace.vpn=default -Dsolace.user=default -Dsolace.password=default -Dsolace.topic=solace/tracing -jar solace-publisher.jar
java -Dsolace.user-properties=‚ÄúmyKey=myValue3‚Äù -Dsolace.host=localhost:55557 -Dsolace.vpn=default -Dsolace.user=default -Dsolace.password=default -Dsolace.topic=solace/tracing -jar solace-publisher.jar
```

### Verifying traced messages in the Jaeger UI

If you look at the details for the third message published, notice how it has a tag with the user property provided by the publisher.
![Jaeger4](img/jaeger4.png)

That value can be used for searching traces. On the Search page, search for the following tag: `messaging.solace.user_properties.myKey=myValue3`
This request should find the third message published.
![Jaeger5](img/jaeger5.png)

### Using Jaeger to debug problems
In an earlier section, we created a queue which had a subscription to topic `solace/tracing`. Let's try publishing a message to the topic `solace/tracing2`, a topic for which no client or endpoint is subscribed.

```console
java -Dsolace.host=localhost:55557 -Dsolace.vpn=default -Dsolace.user=default -Dsolace.password=default -Dsolace.topic=solace/tracing2 -jar solace-publisher.jar
```
Notice the message from the app `No Subscription Match - Topic 'solace/tracing2'`. The message is considered as errored because it was discarded by the broker.

From the Jaeger UI, search for the following tag `error=true`
![Jaeger6](img/jaeger6.png)

If you select the message and expand its detailed view, you will see that the message published had `No Subscription Match`.
![Jaeger7](img/jaeger7.png)

This information can be used to perform any corrective actions, e.g.:
* Fix the publisher and have it publish to the intended topic
* Update the broker configuration and have your queue also subscribe to topic `solace/tracing2`


## Adding context to messages published (JMS automatic instrumentation)

### Clean-up from previous sections
If there are messages on your queue from previous sections, let's take a moment to delete them.
```console
solbroker> enable
solbroker# admin
solbroker(admin)# message-spool message-vpn default
solbroker(admin/message-spool)# delete-messages queue q
This will delete all spooled messages in q
Do you want to continue (y/n)? y
```

### Using solace-publisher app with auto-instrumentation

This command will launch the solace-publisher application and publish a message as well as push additional context information to the collector. Be sure to update this argument's IP to point to your collector: `-Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=http://localhost:4317`

Be sure to replace <absolute_path_to_the_jar_file> with an absolute path to the `tracing-codelab` folder on your machine. There are 2 places in the command where this needs to be done.

```console
[solace@dev tracing-codelab]$ 
java -javaagent:<absolute_path_to_the_jar_file>/opentelemetry-javaagent-all-1.19.0.jar -Dotel.javaagent.extensions=<absolute_path_to_the_jar_file>/solace-opentelemetry-jms-integration-1.0.0.jar -Dotel.propagators=solace_jms_tracecontext -Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=http://localhost:4317 -Dotel.traces.exporter=otlp -Dotel.metrics.exporter=none -Dotel.instrumentation.jms.enabled=true -Dotel.resource.attributes=‚Äúservice.name=SolaceJMSPublisher‚Äù -Dsolace.host=localhost:55557 -Dsolace.vpn=default -Dsolace.user=default -Dsolace.password=default -Dsolace.topic=solace/tracing -jar solace-publisher.jar
```

The following command will launch solace-queue-receiver application to consume the message that was just published as well as provide additional context information directly to the collector about this message being consumed.

Be sure also here to replace <absolute_path_to_the_jar_file> with an absolute path to the `tracing-codelab` folder on your machine. There are 2 places in the command where this needs to be done.

```console
[solace@dev tracing-codelab]$ 
java -javaagent:<absolute_path_to_the_jar_file>/opentelemetry-javaagent-all-1.19.0.jar -Dotel.javaagent.extensions=<absolute_path_to_the_jar_file>/solace-opentelemetry-jms-integration-1.0.0.jar -Dotel.propagators=solace_jms_tracecontext -Dotel.traces.exporter=otlp -Dotel.metrics.exporter=none -Dotel.instrumentation.jms.enabled=true -Dotel.resource.attributes="service.name=SolaceJMSQueueSubscriber" -Dsolace.host=localhost:55557 -Dsolace.vpn=default -Dsolace.user=default -Dsolace.password=default -Dsolace.queue=q -Dsolace.topic=solace/tracing -jar solace-queue-receiver.jar
```

When you are done testing and wish to end the solace-queue-receiver applicaiton, simply send ctrl+c from the keyboard.

### Verify trace generated in Jaeger


A new trace should have been generated, notice how it has 3 spans.
![Jaeger8](img/jaeger8.png)

Opening up the newly generated trace will allow you to easily follow the sequence of events.
![Jaeger9](img/jaeger9.png)

The first span was generated by the publisher when the message was published.

The second span was generated by the PubSub+ Broker when the message was received.

The third span was generated by the consumer when the message was received.


## Clean-up

### Removing created Docker containers

To tear down Docker containers created in an earlier step, run the following command:
```console
[solace@dev ~] $ cd tracing-codelab
[solace@dev tracing-codelab] $ docker compose down
```

To remove Docker images created:
```console
[solace@dev tracing-codelab] $ docker image rm <image id>
```

To view the list of Docker images, you can run the following command:
```console
[solace@dev tracing-codelab]$ docker image ls
```
