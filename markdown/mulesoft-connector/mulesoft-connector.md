Access to a Solace messaging service, Solace PubSub+, can be achieved in either one of the three flavours
1. Hardware Appliance
1. Software broker image (Docker, Virtual image)
1. Solace Cloud service instance

If you already have a Solace PubSub+ Cloud account, you can skip this step

This tutorial will walk you through setting up a Solace Cloud service instance. If you are interested in setting up a local broker running on Docker or a virtual machine check out the [PubSub+ Event  Broker: Software](https://docs.solace.com/Solace-SW-Broker-Set-Up/SW-Broker-Image-Setup.htm) documentation

### Sign up for free Solace Cloud account 
Navigate to the [Create a New Account](https://console.solace.cloud/login/new-account) page and fill out the required information. No credit card required!

### Create a messaging service
After you create your Solace Cloud account and sign in to the Solace Cloud Console, you'll be routed to the event mesh page.

![Solace Cloud Event Mesh Page](img/landing-page-event-mesh.png "Solace Cloud Event Mesh")


Click on 'Messaging Services' and all the messaging services associated with your account will show up if you have any already created. To create a new service, click either button as depicted in the image below:

![Anypoint](img/anypoint.png "Anypoint")

- [Anypoint Studio IDE](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio) has pre-built modules for common integration components like querying backends and routing events. We will be installing the Solace connector in the IDE.
![Anypoint-Studio](img/anypoint_studio.png "Anypoint-Studio")

## Install the Solace Connector
Duration: 0:02:00

- Now that you have Anypoint Studio IDE installed, let's go ahead and create a new project 
![Anypoint-Studio](img/anypoint_studio_intro.png "Anypoint-Studio")

- Give your project a name. Note that you can also scaffold a new MuleSoft project from a template using [RAML](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/design-apis-easily-with-RAML)
![Anypoint-Studio](img/new_project.png "Anypoint-Studio")

- As per the Solace connector documentation on [solace-iot-team/solace-mule-connector](https://github.com/solace-iot-team/solace-mule-connector) github repo, edit the pom.xml file to add a new dependency adn repository

```
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.solace.connector</groupId>
	<artifactId>solace-mulesoft-connector</artifactId>
	<version>0.3.3-SNAPSHOT</version>
	<classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>
```
```
	<repositories>
	<!-- keep all the mulesoft repositories that are configured here --->
		<repository>
			<id>myMavenRepo.read</id>
			<url>https://mymavenrepo.com/repo/27AIdW4GdyXFzutegEs5/</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
```
![pom](img/pom.png "pom")

Positive
: Note: If you are new to Anypoint Studio, you can switch from `Design` to `Source` view for the file ðŸ‘‡

![pom-source](img/pom-source.png "pom-source")


- Save the file. Note that when you save the file, the IDE immediately executes a `mvn install` which installs the solace connector
![connector-install](img/connector-install.png "connector-install")


Positive
: The connector is installed and ready to use ðŸ’¥

## Basic Publisher Flow
Duration: 0:05:00

Now that the connector is installed, go ahead and navigate to `src/main/mule` and double click on the xml file. When you do so, you will see an empty Message Flow canvas
![mainxml](img/mainxml.png "mainxml")

Observe in the Main Palette on the right hand side the Solace Connector with all the different operations that you can use
![solace-palatte](img/solace-palatte.png "solace-palatte")

Let's go ahead and create a basic flow that publishes events on a predefined topic to the previously created solace broker and subscribes on the same topic.

- Drag the publish Palette from the Solace directory into the Message Flow canvas 

![drag-publish](img/drag-publish.png "drag-publish")

- Double click on the Publish object and navigate to the Basic Settings. Click on the green `Add` icon to add a new connection configuration

- Fill in the connection information to configure the Publisher object
![connector-configure2](img/connector-configure2.png "connector-configure2")

Positive
: You can find the host configuration from the `Connect` tab in your Solace Cloud Account 

![connect-tab](img/connect-tab.png "connect-tab")

- Once done, you can test the connection
![connection-success](img/connection-success.png "connection-success")

## Put it all together
Duration: 0:9:00

Now that you have a publisher object configured, let's test it out! In this step, we will configure a scheduler that will publish messages every second on a predefined topic

Positive
: Note: You can use **any** trigger like a post REST request 

### Flow Configuration

- To do so, let's go ahead and search for `Scheduler` under the main palette catalogue on the left hand side of the IDE
![scheduler-pallette](img/scheduler-pallette.png "scheduler-pallette")

- Drag it to the Source section of the flow
![scheduler-flow](img/scheduler-flow.png "scheduler-flow")

- Configure the scheduler to trigger every second
![scheduler-config](img/scheduler-config.png "scheduler-config")

- Now back to the Publisher object, double click on it to configure the topic publish string and the body of the payload. Under the `Deliver Mode` make sure its set to `Direct`. The Destination name field is the topic; populate it with this topic `solace/mule/flow` and add whatever you want in the Message Body

![publish-config](img/publish-config.png "publish-config")

- Click on the canvas and save the file! 

### Subscribe to topic on the broker

Before executing the flow, let's setup a subscriber on the broker to observe the messages flowing. To do so:

- Navigate to your Solace Cloud messaging service, and click on the TryMe! tab
![try-me](img/try-me.png "try-me")

- In the Subscriber section, click on `Connect` and add a topic subscription `solace/mule/>`
![subscriber](img/subscriber.png "subscriber")

Positive
: Notice the usage of the `>` [Solace Wildcard](https://docs.solace.com/PubSub-Basics/Wildcard-Charaters-Topic-Subs.htm)

- Now navigate back to your AnypointStudio and run the flow. You can either do that by clicking the 
![run-flow](img/run-flow.png "run-flow")

- While the flow is running, navigate back to the Solace Cloud console and observe the messages flowing every second  
![subscriber](img/subscriber.gif "subscriber")

And that's it! You can check out more information on [solace-iot-team/solace-mule-connector](https://github.com/solace-iot-team/solace-mule-connector) github repo to see other functionalities with the broker

## [Optional] Add a subscriber flow
Duration: 0:5:00

Now that you have created a publisher flow and tested it out, let's go ahead and create a `TopicListener` object that will connect to the broker and subscribe to the topic we sent. To do so:

- Navigate to the Solace-Connector Palette, drag and drop the `TopicListner` object into the canvas

![topic-listener](img/topic-listener.png "topic-listener")

- Double click on the TopicListner object to configure it. Notice how the Connector Configuration settings is auto populated. Change the Subscription value from `Bean Reference` to `Inline`		
![topic-listner-config](img/topic-listner-config.png "topic-listner-config")	

- Click on the green add icon to add a subscription. Add `solace/mule/>`
![topic-listner-add](img/topic-listner-add.png "topic-listner-add")

- Add a logging shape. Search for `Logger` from the pallette menu and drag it to the TopicListner flow	
![add-logger](img/add-logger.png "add-logger")	

- Configure the logger to log out the received message. Double click on the logger object, in the Message input under Generic, add the following
![logger-config](img/logger-config.png "logger-config")	


```
%dw 2.0
output application/java
---
payload
```

- Your full flow should look like this		
![full-flow](img/full-flow.png "full-flow")		

- Run it! Observe in the logs every second an output of the message will be logged
![log](img/log.png "log")
