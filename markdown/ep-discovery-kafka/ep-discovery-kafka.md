# Guided Walk Through of PubSub+ Event Portal Discovery with Kafka

## Introduction

Duration: 0:02:00

Are you looking to discover, visual, catalog, share, and reuse your Kafka event streams, but don't know how and or where to begin. Or does your organization look something like the picture below and you are struggling to understand what is the data that is really going through your Kafka clusters?

![Kafka Organization](img/kafka_org.png)

Well you have come to the right place, and in this guided walk through, we will show you how to:

* Run a discovery scan on a Kafka cluster (optional - you can instead use our pre-scanned discovery file)
* Upload the scan to PubSub+ Event Portal to visualize the results
* And finally take action on your Kafka consumer groups and topics by linking them to applications, organizing them in a domain, sharing and collaborating on the data with your teams

We expect with this knowledge you will be able to scan your own Kafka clusters to discover & visualize new event streams or consumer groups you may not be aware off. 

To make this walk through engaging and meaningful, we will make use of a real-world use, which we will jump into a bit, and ask you to transport yourself to be an employee of a new company. We also cover some foundational concepts so we all aligned on the same page.

So let's get started!

## Use Case: NYC Taxi Co.

Duration: 0:03:00

You are a member of the engineering team at the _NYC Modern Taxi Co_, a fictional taxi cab company based in New York City. Your team is playing from behind and racing to catch up with technology innovation introduced to the industry by Rideshare competitors such as Uber and Lyft. In order for the company to survive and eventually thrive your team has convinced the board that transforming the companies' IT systems is of utmost importance. Your team has done it's research and determined that moving to an Event-Driven Architecture is essential to future rapid innovation and has already kicked this initiative off by deploying a Solace Event Mesh and updating the taxi fleet to stream real-time events that include ride and location information. We know what the fleet is up to! Now it's time to start to continually improve and provide a world class customer experience.

In order to react in a real-time manner the team has decided that we want to process the updates as they stream in from the fleet of taxis instead of putting them directly into a datastore and then having to retrieve them to do processing later. To prototype this work, you'll see a high level design in the diagram below. Since we already have the taxi fleet streaming their updates into our PubSub+ Event Mesh we need to do three things: 

1. ðŸš– Capture this high level design in the PubSub+ Event Portal where we can define our Event-Driven Architecture, including its' components: Applications, Events and Schemas. This will allow us to define the details needed to implement, visualize and extend the architecture as it evolves, and share/collaborate with our entire engineering team as we continue to innovate.  
1. ðŸš• Next up we're going to create the _RideDropoffProcessor_ microservice which will subscribe to the stream of _dropoff_ taxi updates from the fleet, capture events for a specified time window (we'll use 20 seconds to make it easy), calculate the averages, and publish a new _RideAverageUpdate_ event for each window.  
1. ðŸš– Lastly we'll create a _RideDropoffConsumer_ that receives the stream of _RideAverageUpdate_ events and captures them for display and further processing.

Positive
: The dataset you will be using in this lab originally comes from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission's open data release of more than a billion taxi ride records. Google then extended one week worth of data (3M taxi rides) from their original pickup and drop-off points into full routes in order to simulate a fleet of taxis roaming the streets of NYC as they define [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-dataflow-nyc-taxi-tycoon/?_ga=2.11039092.-1355519641.1572284467/#0). Solace is streaming this data over Solace PubSub+ for you to analyze and process.

## Foundation Concepts

Duration: 0:03:00

Before we dive deeper, let ensure we are all aligned with Kafka objects and concepts we will use in PubSub+ Event Portal. 

Positive
: We are assuming you are familiar with Kafka, its foundation concepts, and have been introduced to PubSub+ Event Portal, so we won't go into depth of explaining the Kafka concepts but rather explain how the relate to the Event Portal. If you are completely new to our Event Portal then watch [this quick 2 mins video](https://share.vidyard.com/watch/cYiSmhz5ZUBh6bavDHAJNQ?) to get overview and create your [free trial account](https://solace.com/products/portal/).

### Consumer Groups

Event Portal supports the concept of Kafka's consumer groups. A consumer group is used by Kafka to group consumers into a logical subscriber for a topic. In Event Portal, you can model consumer groups in Designer. This enables the Event Portal's runtime discovery to associate a discovered consumer group to an existing application. 

Kafka consumers that belong to the same consumer group share a group ID. The consumers in a group divide the topic partitions, as fairly as possible, so that each consumer consumes only a single partition from the group.

![Kafka Consumer Groups](img/consumer_groups.png)

### Topics

Topics are an important part of the Event Portal. Think of a topic as a concept of the publish-subscribe (pub/sub) architectural pattern. They are used to route data or events (in the form of messages) between distributed applications, often using a message broker or an event broker.

A Solace topic and an Apache Kafka topic might seem fundamentally the same but there are quite a few [differences between them](https://solace.com/blog/solace-topics-vs-kafka-topics/). Later in this CodeLab, when you run a discovery scan against a Kafka cluster the Topic Scheme for events discovered will be Kafka format.

### Schemas

In simple terms, a schema represents the contract to describe the payload of an event. Producers and consumers of an event can trust that the event's payload matches the schema definition assigned to that event. Schemas define a type of payload through JSON, AVRO, XML, Binary, or Text. JSON, AVRO, and XML schemas have content that describes each property of the schema. In our Kafka cluster, our events are all in ARVRO Schema format.

### Application Domain & Workspace

An application domain represents a namespace where applications, events, and schemas can live. Within this namespace, you can create a suite of applications, events and schemas that are independent of other application domains. In our NYC Taxi use case we introduced earlier, we may group application into different domains, for ex. we may have a domain for our rideshare apps and services, one for our back-office apps where we invoicing and background checks are being processed, and maybe another domains for analytics where we group apps that are responsible for analyzing the successful operation of our rideshare services.

In the Event Portal you will associate all objects like Consumer Groups, Topics, Schemea, etc, to one or more Application Domains. 

You can further group multiple domains into a *Workspace*. So our Analytics, Operations, and Back-Office Application Domain in the NYC taxi example could be part of a single Workspace.

### Applications

An application represents a piece of software that produces and consumes events. Applications connect to the event broker in an event-driven architecture and communicate with other applications via events. A single application represents a class of applications that are running the same code base; therefore, a Kafka consumer group can be associated with an Application object in the Event Portal. In fact you could have a 1..* consumer group association with an Application.

### Connector

A connector is used in Kafka for connecting Kafka brokers with external systems to stream data into or out of Apache Kafka. In the Event Portal, a Kafka Connector is an application class you select to configure associated published and/or subscribed events and a set of Kafka-native attributes like Connector Type, Class, Cluster ID, and Maximum Task.


With the foundational concepts out of the way, lets go through some prerequisites for running a Discovery scan.

## What you need: Prerequisites

Duration: 0:05:00

You have a choice to pick either of the following options:
1. Scan our NYC Taxi Kafka cluster (which we recommend as it will help you setup to scan your own clusters) or
2. Download one of our pre-scanned Discovery file

You will find some prerequisites for both options below. 

### Option 1: Live Scan Requirements

If you want run a live scan on a Kafka cluster, you will need to download and install the Offline Discovery Agent. As with everything in life, you have two options again:
1. Install the Agent as a Docker Container
2. Install the Agent via a Binary Executable

The most easiest way install the agent is using Docker. Option 2 will require JDK/JRE 11; OpenJDK 11 is bundled with the agent installation package.

If you are on Mac OS or Linux and already have Docker for Desktop installed, then go ahead copy and paste the below command into a terminal window. The Discovery Agent may take a few minutes to initialize. 

Negative
: NOTE: If you are on Windows OS follow the instructions from the documentation [here](https://docs.solace.com/Solace-Cloud/Event-Portal/Discovering-Events-and-EDAs.htm#Install). 
Or if you would like to install the Discovery Agent via a binary executable then refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.solace.com/Solace-Cloud/Event-Portal/Discovering-Events-and-EDAs.htm#Install2).


``` bash
echo 'cMopz4m+GV60hBb8DysZna8uMP4tM84P' | docker login --username discovery-preview --password cMopz4m+GV60hBb8DysZna8uMP4tM84P solaceclouddev.azurecr.io
	docker pull solaceclouddev.azurecr.io/maas-event-discovery-agent:latest
	docker run \
	--env SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME=maas-event-discovery-agent-offline \
	--env EVENT_DISCOVERY_OFFLINE=true \
	--env MAAS_VMR_ENABLED=false \
	--env MAAS_HEARTBEATS_ENABLED=false \
	--env MAAS_RESTPROXY_GATEWAY=false \
	--name discovery_agent -p 8120:8120 \
	-d solaceclouddev.azurecr.io/maas-event-discovery-agent:latest
```

To launch the Discovery Agent go to: [http://localhost:8120](http://localhost:8120).

### Option 2: Pre-Scanned Discovery File

If you don't want to install the agent and run a live scan, you can still follow along in this CodeLab using the following pre-scanned JSON file.

**Download:** [NYC Modern Taxi Co. Analytics Discovery File](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dishantlangayan/dd050e4ea2e3a7d8b14fa4fdca03785a/raw/NYC_Modern_Taxi_Co_Analytics.json)

Or run the curl/git clone command below to download the file:

``` bash
curl -k -XGET https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dishantlangayan/dd050e4ea2e3a7d8b14fa4fdca03785a/raw/NYC_Modern_Taxi_Co_Analytics.json -o NYC_Modern_Taxi_Co_Analytics.json
```

OR

``` bash
git clone  https://gist.github.com/dd050e4ea2e3a7d8b14fa4fdca03785a.git
```

### Some General Requirements

Regardless of the option you chose above, you should also:

1. Sign into your [Solace PubSub+ Cloud account](http://console.solace.cloud/). If you don't have an account yet, go ahead and [create a trial account](https://console.solace.cloud/login/new-account).
2. Ensure that you have the correct user role and permission in Event Portal. At minimum you will need the "Event Portal Editor" permission. For instructions, refer to [Managing Accounts, Roles, and Permissions](https://docs.solace.com/Solace-Cloud/cloud-user-management.htm#Editing).

If you are scanning your own Kafka clusters, then the following event brokers versions are currently supported:
* Apache Kafka versions 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5
* Confluent versions 5.3, 5.4, 5.5
* Amazon MSK version 2.2

## Scan a Kafka Cluster (Optional)
Duration: 0:02:00

Once the Offline Discovery Agent is installed, you can configure and run a scan on our NYC Taxi Kafka cluster from your browser. 

Negative
: NOTE: If you going to use the pre-scanned Discovery file instead then you can skip this section.

### Step 1: Go to the Discovery Agent

Go to [http://localhost:8120](http://localhost:8120)

Select **Confluent** as broker type.

![Run time broker type](img/broker_type.png)

### Step 2: Configure Connection Details

Under the *Target Cluster Authentication*, copy and paste the following:

* **Discovery Name:** `Kafka Discovery CodeLab`
* **Host:** `vmobuajpyc47tci0.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com:9092`
* **Auth:** `No Auth`

Select Add Connector and then copy and paste the Host and Port:

* **Host:** `vmobuajpyc47tci0.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com`
* **Port:** `8083`
* **Authentication:** `No Auth`

![Add Connectors](img/add_connector.png)

Under Schema Registry Authentication, copy and paste the Host and Port:

* **Host:** `vmobuajpyc47tci0.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com`
* **Port:** `8081`
* **Authentication:** `No Auth`

And finally for the *Event Scan Details*, select `Scan for all topics` and click **Start Scan**.

![Event Scan Details](img/select_all_topics_start_scan.png)

### Step 3: Download the Scan File

Now download the scan file to your desktop. The scan file will be in JSON format.

![Download Scan File](img/select_all_topics_start_scan.png)

Now on to the fun part where we will upload the scan to Event Portal and visualize the result. 

## Review Scan In Staging
Duration: 0:010:00



### Uploading Your Scan File

Open your PubSub+ Cloud Console account and navigate to the Event Portal Discovery. Here you can upload your scan file you download in the last step or use our [pre-scanned file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dishantlangayan/dd050e4ea2e3a7d8b14fa4fdca03785a/raw/NYC_Modern_Taxi_Co_Analytics.json) instead. For the purpose of walk through we will be using the pre-scanned file below.

![Upload Scan File](img/upload_scan_file.png)

### Assign to Workspace

One of the first things we want to do is to organize our work in a Workspace. Click on your scan file from the table and select **Assign to Workspace**.

![Assign to Workspace](img/assign_to_workspace.png)

Lets create a new Workspace called `NYC Modern Tax Co`.

### Staging View

Once your workspace is created you'll see the Staging view. What you essentially have here is all the objects the Discovery agent found in the Kafka cluster it scanned. There are a few Consumer Groups that were discovered, a few Kafka Connectors, some Topics and Schemas.

![Staging View](img/staging_view.png)

This is where you will map what you have discovered to Applications and Events in the Event Portal, and make associations with your domain.

### Creating an App Domain

First we need to associate the Consumer Groups, Connectors, Topics, and Schema that were discovered from our NYC Taxi Analytics cluster to a Domain. 

![Create App Domain](img/create_app_domain.png)

Double click on the domain that was created to rename it. We will call this Domain: `NYC Modern Taxi Co - Analytics`

![Rename Domain](img/rename_domain.png)

### Assigning Consumer Groups, Topics, Schemas to the App Domain

Now lets assign our discovered Analytics Consumers Groups, Connectors, Topics, and Schema to the domain we created.

Positive
: In reality you may have tons of Consumers or Topics, so to ensure we are making the right associations with a domain, we can use the search capability to filter our Analytics objects only.

Filter and select Consumer Groups:

![Consumers Groups to App Domain](img/assign_consumers_to_domain.png)

Repeat the same for Connectors, Topics, and Schemas:

![Consumers Groups to App Domain](img/assign_topics_to_domain.png)

![Consumers Groups to App Domain](img/assign_schema_to_domain.png)

### Mapping Consumer Groups & Topics to Applications

With the objects associated to a Domain, the Event Portal will automatically map those Consumer Groups, Connectors, and Topics to a Applications and Events. Click on the Domain name at the top navigation bar to see a graph view of what has been mapped.
