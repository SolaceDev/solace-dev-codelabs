  "summary": "TThis document is an integration guide for using Solace PubSub+ as a JMS provider for an Apache Spark Streaming custom receiver.Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. It provides an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and structured data processing, MLib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming for high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams. The Spark Streaming custom receiver is a simple interface that allows third party applications to push data into Spark in an efficient manner.",
