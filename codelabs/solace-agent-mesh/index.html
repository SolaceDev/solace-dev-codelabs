        <h2 is-upgraded>Problem statement</h2>
<p>Building effective agentic systems presents a complex challenge that extends far beyond simply deploying AI models. AI Agents are siloed systems that operate in isolation, and are unable to effectively communicate or share capabilities across organizational boundaries. <strong>By definition and design, Agents are inherently domain-specific, designed to excel in narrow use cases but struggling to collaborate or leverage expertise from other specialized agents, creating fragmented AI ecosystems that fail to realize their collective potential.</strong></p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Fragmented" src="img/a3864d5d59ef93ff.png"></p>
<p>To make intelligent decisions and respond to dynamic conditions, agentic systems must rely on event-driven actions that flow into the organization. While solving the core AI challenge represents only 20% of the effort, the remaining 80% involves the much more complex task of connecting AI models to the disparate data sources, legacy systems, APIs, and organizational knowledge that exist across isolated silos—making data accessibility and integration the true bottleneck in delivering practical AI value</p>
<aside class="warning"><p> Without a framework like Solace Agent Mesh, connecting AI systems to siloed data sources can be extremely complex, requiring custom integration code and pointing to point connections resulting in maintenance challenges.</p>

        <p>As mentioned earlier, Agents are specialized processing units built around ADK. They provide domain-specific knowledge and capabilities and can operate independently and be deployed separately.</p>
<p>In Solace Agent Mesh, Agents are configuration driven vial YAML files and there are multiple ways to develop an agent:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Using built-in templates,</li>
<li>Using the <code>sam add agent</code> cli command</li>
<li>Using the GUI interface <code>sam add agent --gui</code></li>

<h2 is-upgraded>Agent Cards in the A2A Specification</h2>
<p>Agent Cards are a critical component of the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol specification. They serve as the &#34;identity&#34; and capability declaration for agents in a distributed system.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What Are Agent Cards?</h2>
<p>An Agent Card is a document (in JSON format) that describes an agent&#39;s:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity (name, description, version)</li>
<li>Capabilities (what the agent can do)</li>
<li>Skills (specific functions or abilities)</li>
<li>Service endpoint URL (how to reach the agent)</li>
<li>Authentication requirements (how to authenticate)</li>
<li>Interaction protocols (how to communicate)</li>
</ul>
<p>Agent Cards enable agents to discover each other and understand how to interact appropriately. They are the foundation of the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol that Solace Agent Mesh implements.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Agent Card Structure</h2>
<p>In the Solace Agent Mesh YAML configuration, the agent card is defined within the <code>agent_card</code> section of the agent&#39;s configuration file. Internally, this is translated to a JSON document that follows the A2A specification.</p>
<p>The agent card includes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Basic Metadata</strong><ul>
<li><code>description</code>: A human-readable description of the agent&#39;s purpose</li>
<li><code>defaultInputModes</code>: Formats the agent accepts as input (e.g., &#34;text&#34;, &#34;image&#34;)</li>
<li><code>defaultOutputModes</code>: Formats the agent produces as output</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Skills Section</strong><ul>
<li>Lists the specific capabilities or services the agent offers</li>
<li>Each skill has an ID, name, and description</li>
<li>Skills are discoverable by other agents for delegation and collaboration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Authentication Information</strong> (optional)<ul>
<li>Methods for authenticating with the agent</li>
<li>Required scopes or permissions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Capabilities Declaration</strong> (optional)<ul>
<li>Special features the agent supports (streaming, attachments, etc.)</li>
<li>Extension capabilities beyond core A2A functionality</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 is-upgraded>Benefits of the YAML Configuration Approach</h2>
<p>The YAML-based configuration approach in Solace Agent Mesh provides several key benefits:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Configuration-driven:</strong> Precise control over agent behavior, service integrations, and security settings without code changes</li>
<li><strong>Security-first approach:</strong> Built-in authorization framework with fine-grained access control</li>
<li><strong>Resilient by nature:</strong> Event-driven design creates responsive, self-healing interactions</li>
<li><strong>Standardized discovery:</strong> A2A-compliant agent cards enable seamless agent integration and collaboration</li>
</ol>
<p>This configuration approach is particularly valuable for building complex multi-agent systems where agents need to discover and collaborate with each other based on their respective capabilities and skills.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Built-in tools" duration="7">
        <p>Built-in tools in the Solace Agent Mesh are a comprehensive set of capabilities that enable agents to perform complex tasks, interact with various systems, and collaborate effectively within the mesh ecosystem. These tools extends the native capabilities offered by the <a href="https://google.github.io/adk-docs/" target="_blank">Agent Development Kit (ADK)</a>. This of these tool as native functionalities that agents have access to like &#34;functions&#34; instead of building these from scratch.</p>
<p>The Solace Agent Mesh comes with a series of built-in tools natively to the platform. Each built-in tool name is defined in the <code>tools</code> section of the application configuration for the agent in the yaml config file as follows</p>
<pre><code language="language-yaml" class="language-yaml">tools:
   - tool_type: builtin
     tool_name: &#34;tool_name&#34;
</code></pre>
<aside class="special"><p> Note that this is a developing open source framework and more built-in tools will be developed and introduced. Learn more about the available tools from the <a href="https://solacelabs.github.io/solace-agent-mesh/docs/documentation/user-guide/builtin-tools/" target="_blank">Built-in Tool documentation</a></p>
</aside>
<p><strong>1. Artifact Management Tools</strong></p>
<p>Artifact management tools handle the creation, storage, and retrieval of content and data objects across the agent ecosystem. They ensure artifacts such as documents, code, or structured data can be versioned, shared, and persistently stored while also supporting format conversion for interoperability. These tools make it easier for agents to generate and reuse artifacts seamlessly.</p>
<p><strong>2. Data Analysis Tools</strong></p>
<p>Data analysis tools allow agents to process, transform, and analyze data from a variety of sources. They support statistical analysis, natural language processing, and visualization generation, enabling agents to extract insights from both structured and unstructured data. With built-in query functions, these tools can also handle natural language queries against different data stores.</p>
<p><strong>3. Web Tools</strong></p>
<p>Web tools empower agents to interact directly with web-based resources and services. They support sending HTTP requests, retrieving and parsing content, and integrating with APIs while managing authentication methods like OAuth or API keys. In permitted cases, they also enable web scraping and structured response handling.</p>
<p><strong>4. Peer Agent Delegation Tools</strong></p>
<p>Peer agent delegation tools make collaboration among agents more efficient by supporting the distribution of tasks across specialized agents. They allow context to be shared, results to be aggregated, and coordination strategies to be applied, whether sequential, parallel, or conditional. These tools also enable agents to discover expertise and provide feedback to one another.</p>
<p><strong>5. Developer Tools</strong></p>
<p>Developer tools help streamline the development, deployment, and maintenance of the agent mesh. They include command-line utilities for management, debugging interfaces for real-time monitoring, and configuration management systems for precise control. Additionally, observability and testing frameworks provide insights into system health and validation of agent performance.</p>
<p><strong>6. System Integration Tools</strong></p>
<p>System integration tools connect agents with external backend systems and enterprise platforms. They provide connectors to databases, event streams, and message queues while also allowing controlled file system access. These tools extend the mesh&#39;s capabilities by integrating AI models and external enterprise applications into agent workflows.</p>
<p>Lets take an example for a <code>web-request</code> agent</p>
<pre><code language="language-yaml" class="language-yaml">- name: web_agent_app
    app_base_path: .
    app_module: solace_agent_mesh.agent.sac.app

      display_name: &#34;Web Content&#34;
      model: *planning_model # Or another appropriate model from shared_config.yaml
      instruction: |
        You are an agent that can fetch content from web URLs using the &#39;web_request&#39; tool.
        You can make various types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) and include custom headers or a body.
        The tool will return the fetched content (HTML converted to Markdown, other text types as is, or raw binary data).
        You will then need to process this content based on the user&#39;s request.
        Always save useful fetched content as an artifact.

      tools:
        - tool_type: builtin
          tool_name: &#34;web_request&#34;
        - tool_type: builtin-group
          group_name: &#34;artifact_management&#34;
</code></pre>
<p>This yaml configuration of a Web Agent uses two types of tools: a built-in tool <code>web_request</code> that handles web requests and a group of built-in tools <code>artifact_management</code> that handles artifact access</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Plugins Ecosystem" duration="10">
        <p>Plugins serve as the backbone of the Solace Agent Mesh extensible architecture, providing a structured way to package, distribute, and incorporate new features into any SAM deployment. They are modular Python packages that extend the agent mesh&#39;s capabilities through specialized components that integrate seamlessly with the A2A protocol.</p>
<p>To spin up the list of the core plugins offered by the Solace Agent Mesh, execute the following</p>
<pre><code>sam plugin catalog

<p class="image-container"><img alt="simpleFlow" src="img/b81a38a6fb8c21eb.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Types of plugins</h2>
<p>Solace Agent Mesh supports three primary categories of plugins, each serving different purposes within the ecosystem:</p>
<p><strong>Agent Plugins</strong> These contain specialized agents with domain-specific capabilities. They extend the system&#39;s ability to perform specific tasks or interact with particular data sources or services. For example, an agent plugin might specialize in processing financial data or analyzing medical imagery.</p>
<p><strong>Gateway Plugins</strong> These provide new interface types for external system integration, enabling SAM to connect with various user interfaces, APIs, or communication channels. Gateway plugins might add support for channels like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or custom web interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Plugins</strong> These implement specialized integrations that don&#39;t fit neatly into the agent or gateway categories. Examples include connectors for specific enterprise systems, data transformation services, or security extensions.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Where to get plugins?</h2>
<p>The Solace Agent Mesh ecosystem encompasses both official and community-developed plugins:</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Official Core Plugins</h3>
