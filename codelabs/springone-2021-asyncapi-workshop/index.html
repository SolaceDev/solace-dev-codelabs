        <p class="image-container"><img alt="Cloud Stream Intro" src="img/f4bfccdf4fb492d0.png"></p>
<p>Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for creating highly scalable, event-driven microservices connected by pluggable messaging services. Messaging services are pluggable via Binders that we&#39;ll cover in a bit. The framework is based on Spring Boot and Spring Integration.</p>
<p>Spring Cloud Stream has three different types of message exchange contracts as pictures below.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Suppliers are sources of events</li>
<li>Sinks are consumers of events</li>
<li>Processors are both consumers and subscribers of events</li>
</ol>
<h2 is-upgraded>Message Exchange Contracts Map to Java Functions</h2>
<p>As of Spring Cloud Stream v3 the preferred programming model is to use Java Functions to implement your cloud stream apps.</p>
<p>We just mentioned the 3 types of Cloud Stream message exchange contract are &#34;Sources&#34;, &#34;Sinks&#34; and &#34;Processors&#34;. Those map to functions as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>java.util.function.Supplier</code> -&gt; Source [Producer/Publisher of Events]</li>
<li><code>java.util.function.Consumer</code> -&gt; Sink [Subscriber/Consumer of Events]</li>
<li><code>java.util.function.Function</code> -&gt; Processor [ Consumes, Processes, and Produces Events ]</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Binders</h2>
<p>Spring Cloud Stream Binders are really what make the framework useful. Binders provide an abstraction layer between your code and the messaging systems over which events are flowing. This allows you to write your code without having to worry about learning messaging APIs! When messages are sent or received from the messaging system they pass through the messaging system specific binder which knows how to communicate with that specific message broker.</p>
<p>As of the creation of this codelab the available Cloud Stream Binders are:</p>
<ul>
<li>RabbitMQ</li>
<li>Apache Kafka</li>
<li>Amazon Kinesis</li>
<li>Google PubSub</li>
<li>Solace PubSub+</li>
<li>Azure Event Hubs</li>
<li>Apache RocketMQ</li>
</ul>
<aside class="special"><p>Today we&#39;re going to use the <a href="https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-spring-cloud/tree/master/solace-spring-cloud-starters/solace-spring-cloud-stream-starter" target="_blank">Solace PubSub+ Binder</a> which supports publish subscribe and consumer groups.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Communication Models</h2>
<p>Instead of having to learn Messaging APIs, developers just have to understand the communication models that Spring Cloud Stream supports. There are 3 supported models, but support varies per binder.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Publish-subscribe: subscribers are independent from each other &amp; receive events in order</li>
<li>Consumer groups: fan-out and load-balancing across multiple consumers</li>
<li>Stateful partitioning support: in-order processing for consistency and performance</li>
</ol>

      <google-codelab-step label="AsyncAPI" duration="3">

        <p class="image-container"><img src="img/5f976eae3b11e73e.png"></p>
<p>AsyncAPI has emerged as the industry standard for defining asynchronous, event-driven APIs; you can think of it as OpenAPI for the asynchronous world.</p>
<p>It is an open source initiative that provides both</p>
<ul>
<li>a specification to describe and document your asynchronous applications in a machine-readable format, and</li>
<li>tooling (such as code generators) to make life easier for developers tasked with implementing them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>AsyncAPI Document</h2>
<p>An AsyncAPI document that defines the application that you want to develop. This document can be represented as JSON objects conforming to the JSON standards, or an YAML file. You can either manually create the document or use an event portal.</p>
<p>The AsyncAPI initiative provides a handy, interactive tool called the <a href="https://playground.asyncapi.io" target="_blank">AsyncAPI playground</a> to make the document creation easier.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="AsyncAPI Playground" src="img/71a9c5c8c7eabdb4.jpg"></p>
<p>Alternatively you can generate this document from EDA tools such as <a href="https://solace.com/products/portal/" target="_blank">Event Portal</a> of Solace PubSub+ platform. Typically they are design-time tools allowing architects and developers to collaborate using a GUI to design the event-driven architecture.</p>
<p>Having a catalog of well-organized channels and events for reuse will also save you both time and headaches while collaborating, instead of having to comb through a bunch of files in various locations.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>AsyncAPI Generator</h2>
<p>AsyncAPI Generator is a tool that can generate a skeleton code from the AsyncAPI document, reducing the need to laboriously create boilerplate code saving time and effort.</p>
<p>The AsyncAPI Code Generator supports templates to generate code for a variety of different languages and protocols, but for this workshop we&#39;re going to use the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/java-spring-cloud-stream-template" target="_blank">Spring Cloud Stream template</a>.</p>
<p>The Spring Cloud Stream framework provides an easy way to get started with event-driven microservices by providing binders that allow the developer to create their microservices without having to learn messaging APIs.</p>
<pre><code>Example:

ag ~/AsyncApiDocument.yaml https://github.com/asyncapi/java-spring-cloud-stream-template.git
</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Coding Business Logic</h2>
<p>The generated spring project is a regular Spring Boot Java project with generated classes under the javaPackage and an <em>application.yml</em> file for configuration. It contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generated classes under javaPackage include POJOs defined from the schemas in the AsyncAPI document and</li>
<li><em>Application.java</em> which contains the actual Spring Cloud Functions to handle messages delivered on the channels as defined in the AsyncAPI document where we&#39;ll add our business logic.</li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Event Mesh" duration="3">

        <p class="image-container"><img src="img/124f1525945a39ad.png"></p>
<p>An Event Mesh is a configurable and dynamic infrastructure layer for distributing events among decoupled applications, cloud services and devices.</p>
<p>It enables event communications to be governed, flexible, reliable and fast. An event mesh is created and enabled through a network of interconnected event brokers.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>How is &#34;event mesh&#34; different from service mesh?</h2>
<p><a href="https://solace.com/blog/event-mesh-service-mesh-for-microservices/" target="_blank">Event mesh complements service mesh</a> completing the application connectivity layer to provide the full set of inter-application communication patterns enterprises need to realize their digital transformation ambitions. It is a layer parallel to service mesh and completes the application architecture by providing the full set of inter-application communication patterns.</p>
<p>Service mesh for RESTful and general request/reply interactions; event mesh for asynchronous, event-based interactions.</p>
<p>Both meshes are similar in that they enable better communication between applications by putting certain functions into a layer between the network and the application. However, there are a few important distinctions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Service mesh connects microservices in cloud environments – Kubernetes only today – with the promise of enabling this communication between different Kubernetes clusters and perhaps other clouds in the future.</li>
<li>Event mesh connects not only microservices but also legacy applications, cloud-native services, devices, and data sources/sinks and these can operate both in cloud and non-cloud environments. An event mesh can connect any event source to any event handler.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/61e319beddc18f7d.gif"></p>
<p>An event mesh is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Inherently ‘event-driven&#39;</li>
<li>Created by connecting event brokers</li>
<li>Environment agnostic (can be deployed anywhere) and</li>
<li>Dynamic</li>

        <p>API products are groups of related APIs that fulfil some business functions, often in a bounded content helping others to consume your Business capabilities.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Event-Driven APIs</h2>
<p>Event-Driven APIs offers a subscription &#34;push&#34; model rather than the request-response model of conventional RESTful APIs. They are implemented using an event gateway for publish/subscribe distribution.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/b580e6bce337e55d.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>API Product implementations employs microservice architecture internally and expose the functionality through APIs, while hiding the underlying implementation.</li>

        <p>Next step in building an Event API product involves bundling of high-value, share-worthy events. The resulting bundle is released as a specification for public consumption. The generated specification is based on a commonly understood standard - like AsyncAPI.</p>
<p>AsyncAPI also provides tools to generate code (supports popular languages) helping consumers directly go from spec-to-code, leaving the only responsibility of updating the business logic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the Event API product name, description and server connection settings (connection url and protocol). <img src="img/1b11b9beb1c0de56.jpg"></li>
<li>Grant permission on events for Publish &amp; Subscribe <img src="img/aa89e71f7ae7e66.jpg"></li>

        <p class="image-container"><img src="img/948c3e9782a067f1.jpg"></p>
<p>SmartTown EDA implementation is expected to expose the City-based Temperature Alert events for external consumption based on the TemperatureReading events published by the IoT Sensors.</p>
<p>This would result in two distinct microservices:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A Sensor Data Simulator microservice, which will publish temperature reading every second (or a fixed period). For simplicity sake, the reading of CPU temperature where the microservice is run is used.</li>
<li>A second microservice that subscribes to the temperature reading events and publish an alert event with appropriate priority set.</li>
</ol>
<h2 is-upgraded>IoT Data Collector Microservice (Sensor Data Simulator)</h2>
<p>In real world, this would have been a service that any device that collects temperature reading from a device (using IoT sensors) and publish an event with device context details like location, zone, device id, device class, timestamp etc.</p>
<p>In this workshop, we will be using a pre-built simulator microservice to publish temperature reading events. Essentially, it is a spring boot application that connects to Solace PubSub+ Broker and publishes a temperature reading event.</p>
<aside class="special"><p>We may have to update the connection credentials on necessary configuration files to connect to the Event Broker hosting the SmartTown EDA solution</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>AC-City Alert Generator Microservice</h2>
<p>A microservice that subscribes to temperature reading events and generates alerts based on the detected temperature range with appropriate priority (LOW, MEDIUM or HIGH). This alert event carries the context of city, alert type and level to facilitate a city-level temperature alert aggregation and management.</p>
<p>In this workshop, this application will be built from scratch by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Downloading the AsyncAPI document of the Event API Product on the Solace PubSub+ platform</li>
<li>Generating Spring Cloud Stream microservice from the AsyncAPI document</li>
<li>Implementing business logic to generate alert</li>

<li>Execute the following command <br><code>cd ~/github<br>git clone https://github.com/Mrc0113/smarttown.git<br></code></li>
</ul>
<p>This would create a directory by name <strong>smarttown</strong> and checkout the git repository contents.   <img src="img/94886ba9f23033a9.jpg"></p>
<p>The directory <strong>github/cloudstream/iot-data-collector</strong> contains a prebuilt spring cloud stream project that can readily publish temperature reading data. You just have to update the application.yml configuration with host details.</p>

<h3 is-upgraded>TemperatureReading.java</h3>
<p>✅ Review the TemperatureReading java file. It carries temperature reading data - a simple POJO with attributes and corresponding getters/setters.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Application.java</h3>
<p>✅ Review the Application.java, specifically the Supplier function.</p>
<pre><code>@Bean
Supplier&lt;Message&lt;TemperatureReading&gt;&gt; publishTemperatureData()  {
  return () -&gt; {
    // Collect CPU metrics 
    SystemInfo si = new SystemInfo();
    HardwareAbstractionLayer hal = si.getHardware();
    Sensors sensors = hal.getSensors();
    CentralProcessor processor = hal.getProcessor();
    double[] loadAverage = processor.getSystemLoadAverage(1);
    BigDecimal cpuLoad = new BigDecimal((loadAverage[0] &lt; 0 ? 0 : loadAverage[0]));
    BigDecimal cpuTemp = new BigDecimal(50.0 + cpuLoad.doubleValue() * 8.0);
    // Construct the topic name with alert type and priority as per the Topic hierarchy design
    // SmartTown/Operations/temperatureReading/created/v1/{city}/{latitude}/{longitude}
    String topic = &#34;SmartTown/Operations/temperatureReading/created/v1/&#34; + city + &#34;/&#34; + latitude + &#34;/&#34; + longitude;	        			
    TemperatureReading data = new TemperatureReading(cpuLoad, city, latitude, longitude, cpuTemp);
    logger.info(data.toString());	

    // Set the target destination on the message with the constructed topic name
    return MessageBuilder.withPayload(data)
            .setHeader(BinderHeaders.TARGET_DESTINATION, topic)
            .build();		
  };
}	

</code></pre>
<p>✅ The Supplier function is a Cloud Stream message exchange contract that publishes an event to configured Event Broker.</p>
<p>✅ Notice the topic name construction:</p>
<p><strong>SmartTown/Operations/temperatureReading/created/v1/{city}/{latitude}/{longitude}</strong></p>
<p>The values for variables <em>city, latitude</em> and <em>longitude</em> are read from the configuration file via @Value annotation.</p>
<pre><code>    @Value(&#34;${application.latitude}&#34;)
    public BigDecimal latitude;
    @Value(&#34;${application.longitude}&#34;)
    public BigDecimal longitude;
    @Value(&#34;${application.city}&#34;)
    public String city;

</code></pre>
<p>The topic name is dynamically constructed by concatenating the root topic name and dynamic values picked up from the application configuration.</p>
<p>✅ The return value from the <em>Supplier</em> function is a Spring Cloud Stream <em>Message</em> that is set with destination as the dynamic topic and published to the Broker.</p>
<p>✅ The temperature simulation is closely tied to CPU load on the machine, which can be manipulated using <em>stress</em> system utility. The simulation logic is built to generate a temperature value as a multiple of CPU load.</p>
<aside class="special"><p><em>stress</em> utility is used to dynamically increase the CPU load, which in turn affects the simulation to produce higher temperature readings.</p>

<pre><code>stress -c 6 -t 180
</code></pre>
<p>As the CPU load increases, you will see the temperature reading increasing as well. This variation will help the alert generator microservice (next one) to publish temperature alerts with different priority levels.</p>

        <p>We will be building this microservice using AsyncAPI Generator tool from the AsyncAPI document hosted by the PubSub+ Event Portal.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Review API Product URL</h2>
<p>✅ Open Chrome browser and go to the following url:</p>
<p><em>[Instructor to share the AsyncAPI public url]</em></p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/30c3f2e560d9dddc.jpg"></p>
<p>You can click on the <strong>Download YAML</strong> button and download the document from this portal - just you need to move it to the cloudstream folder.</p>
<p>Run the following command on a terminal window</p>
<pre><code>mv ~/Downloads/asyncapi.yaml ~/github/smarttown/asyncapi/
</code></pre>
<p>✅ Make the following updates to the asyncapi.yaml file</p>
<pre><code>Append the line below 

      x-scs-function-name: processTemperatureReading

a) After 

channels:
  SmartTown/Operations/OperationalAlert/created/v1/{AlertPriority}/{AlertType}:
    subscribe:

b) And after

  SmartTown/Operations/temperatureReading/created/v1/{city}/{latitude}/{longitude}:
    publish:
</code></pre>
<p>With this change, the channels section of the YAML file will look like this</p>
<pre><code>channels:
  SmartTown/Operations/OperationalAlert/created/v1/{AlertPriority}/{AlertType}:
    subscribe:
      x-scs-function-name: processTemperatureReading
      message:

</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Generate code usign AsyncAPI Code Generator</h2>
<p>✅ Change directory to cloudstream and run the following command</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/github/smarttown/cloudstream
</code></pre>
<aside class="special"><p>Before you proceed, make sure that you have received connection details for the Solace PubSub+ Event Broker from the instructor and keep it handy.</p>
</aside>
<p>Run the following command to invoke AsyncAPI code generator utility.</p>
<pre><code>ag -o ac-city-alert-generator -p binder=solace -p dynamicType=header -p artifactId=ac-city-alert-generator  -p groupId=com.springone -p javaPackage=com.springone.asyncapi.alertgenerator -p host=tcp://mrnsau5ltlr4o.messaging.solace.cloud:55555 -p username=smarttown -p password=smarttown -p msgVpn=springone-2021 ../asyncapi/asyncapi.yaml @asyncapi/java-spring-cloud-stream-template --force-write
</code></pre>
<p>This command will take some time (minute or so) and complete with the following message.</p>
<pre><code>Done! ✨
Check out your shiny new generated files at /home/ubuntu/github/smarttown/cloudstream/ac-city-alert-generator.
</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Open Spring Tool Suite</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open Spring Cloud Suite tool by clicking on the icon in the desktop (if not open already)</li>
<li>Import cloud stream projects from the smarttown folder as ‘Existing maven projects&#39; and choose smarttown/cloudstream folder. <img src="img/abdd429eeb4200de.jpg"></li>
</ul>
<h3 is-upgraded>TemperatureReading.java</h3>
<p>✅ Review the TemperatureReading java file. It carries temperature reading data - a simple POJO with attributes and corresponding getters/setters.</p>
<p>It is same as the TemperatureReading POJO present in the iot-data-collector microservice.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>OperationalAlert.java</h3>
<p>✅ Review the OperationalAlert java file. It carries operational alert data - a simple POJO with attributes and corresponding getters/setters.</p>
<aside class="warning"><p>Add the import statement manually at the top of the file along with other import statements. <br><code>import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;<br></code></p>
</aside>
<h3 is-upgraded>Application.java</h3>
<p>✅ Review the Application.java, specifically the Supplier function.</p>
<aside class="warning"><p>Add the @Bean annotation before the Function statement <br><code>@Bean<br>public Function&lt;TemperatureReading, Message&lt;OperationalAlert&gt;&gt; processTemperatureReading() {<br></code></p>

</aside>
<p>Let us review the Function</p>
<pre><code>@Bean
  public Function&lt;TemperatureReading, Message&lt;OperationalAlert&gt;&gt; processTemperatureReading() {
    return data -&gt; {
      // Add business logic here.
      logger.info(data.toString());
      String alertType = &#34;string&#34;;
      String alertPriority = &#34;string&#34;;
      String topic = String.format(&#34;SmartTown/Operations/OperationalAlert/created/v1/%s/%s&#34;,
        alertType, alertPriority);
      OperationalAlert payload = new OperationalAlert();
      Message message = MessageBuilder
        .withPayload(payload)
        .setHeader(BinderHeaders.TARGET_DESTINATION, topic)
        .build();

      return message;
    };
  }
</code></pre>
<p>This Spring Cloud Stream <em>Function</em> contract is a processor that subscribes to <strong>TemperatureReading</strong> message, and publishes a <strong>OperationalAlert</strong> message.</p>
<p>The business logic of what transpires in this function is something we will be coding here. Our goal is to generate Alerts of HighTemperature type with three distinct priority levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>LOW: When temperature &gt; 60 and &lt;= 70</li>
<li>MEDIUM: When temperature &gt; 70 and &lt;= 80</li>
<li>HIGH: When temperature &gt; 80</li>
</ul>
<p>With the updated logic, the Function contract will be</p>
<pre><code>@Bean
public Function&lt;TemperatureReading, Message&lt;OperationalAlert&gt;&gt; processTemperatureReading() {
  return data -&gt; {
    // NOTE: A return value of null indicates that no message will be published to the Broker 
    if (data.getMCpuTemp().doubleValue() &lt;= 60)
      return null;
    
    // Since the goal is to generate temperature alerts, set the alertType to a 
    // default value of &#39;HighTemperature&#39; 
    String alertType = &#34;HighTemperature&#34;; // HighCpuLoad
    
    // Based on the defined bounds for Low, Medium and High temperature,
    // check the incoming temperature reading and set the alert priority appropriately
    String alertPriority = &#34;High&#34;;
    if (data.getMCpuTemp().doubleValue() &gt; 60 &amp;&amp; data.getMCpuTemp().doubleValue() &lt;= 70)
      alertPriority = &#34;Low&#34;;
    else if (data.getMCpuTemp().doubleValue() &gt; 70 &amp;&amp; data.getMCpuTemp().doubleValue() &lt;= 80)
      alertPriority = &#34;Medium&#34;;
    
    // Construct the topic name with alert type and priority as per the Topic hierarchy design
    //		SmartTown/Operations/OperationalAlert/created/v1/{AlertPriority}/{AlertType}
    String topic = String.format(&#34;SmartTown/Operations/OperationalAlert/created/v1/%s/%s&#34;,
      alertType, alertPriority);
    
    // Construct an OperatinalAlert object 
    OperationalAlert payload = new OperationalAlert(alertPriority, alertType, data.getMCity(), data.getMCpuTemp(), 
                            data.getMLatitude(), data.getMLongitude());
    
    logger.info(&#34;Operational Alert: \n&#34; + payload.toString());
    

    // Add OperationalAlert as type parameter to Message declaration (AsyncAPI codegen will fix this soon)
    Message&lt;OperationalAlert&gt; message = MessageBuilder
      .withPayload(payload)
      .setHeader(BinderHeaders.TARGET_DESTINATION, topic)
      .build();

    return message;
  };
</code></pre>
<p>There could be other internal services like monitor and external applications like analytics, dashboard could subscribe to this Alert event.</p>
<p>✅ Notice the topic name construction:</p>
<p><strong>SmartTown/Operations/OperationalAlert/created/v1/{AlertPriority}/{AlertType}</strong></p>
<p>The topic name is dynamically constructed by concatenating the root topic name and computed values for <em>AlertPriority</em>, and <em>AlertType</em> .</p>
<p>✅ The return value from the <em>Function</em> function is a Spring Cloud Stream <em>Message</em> that is set with destination as the dynamic topic and published to the Broker.</p>
<p>✅ The temperature simulation is closely tied to CPU load on the machine, which can be manipulated using <em>stress</em> system utility. The simulation logic is built to generate a temperature value as a multiple of CPU load.</p>

</aside>
<aside class="special"><p>2. Note the City name you used in the iot-data-collector microservice, as you would want to use the same city name to subscribe to TemperatureReading events. Otherwise, this microservice will end up receiving TemperatureReading events from all cities.</p>

<h3 is-upgraded>Simulating CPU load to generate</h3>
<p>✅ Open a terminal, change directory to ac-city-alert-generator project and run the following maven command.</p>
<aside class="special"><p><em>stress</em> utility is used to dynamically increase the CPU load, which in turn affects the simulation to produce higher temperature readings. To run the stress command, type:<br><br><code>stress -c 6 -t 180</code><br><br> This will simulate load on the VM and till timeout after 180 seconds.</p>
